Introductory chapter that puts everything in context.

  Dima recommends:
  
  intro can list char'n of magcoll geny as a key result)
  For the intro, summarize your results (destroy sat at inacc, Mag gen & MS, magcoll charn of geny)
    Don't go further back than Cohen. Talk about failure of CH, GCH, powerset. Easton's Thm for regs.
    For sings, much more interesting. Can't just use Cohen poset, need large cards. Magidor, from s.c. and later by Mitchell, Woodin, reduced and made optimal (to o(kappa)=kappa++).
    We combine techniques of forcings and large cardinals, where LCs are strengthenings of ZFC, (ConZFC or Konig infinity lemma), and much stronger ones that satisfy omega-like compactness results. (Can even note that omega is in a sense a "ctble inaccessible)
    (Mention cpctness props, incl stat refl'n for reg cards)
    
    For very large cards, have a measure-like object, equiv. to j:VtoM eltary. Stronger closure properties of M (more V-like) === larger cards.
    
    M equiv to taking the "ultrapower"; can also get *an* ultrapower by *forcing* with an ideal that gives a gen filter that is V-ultra, so gives j:VtoM in gen ext.
    Want to investigate properties of such ultrapowers; properties of such ideals tell props of their gen ults.
    
    Now we can describe antisaturation results.
    Tie MS to being both a cpctness property, and an antisat result for NS.
    
    Then describe the organization:
    Preliminaries are prelims; cover basics, note interesting stuff in Mag forcing ch.
    destroy_sat covers getting nonsat'd but still nice ideals at an inaccessible cardinal and was first my preprint on the arXiv.
    MS chapter describes MS, and also new result that mag gens satisfy MS like Prikry gens.
    accesssible_MS describes ongoing pf of concept project to get MS results at aleph_omega_1. Here we define and prove results about a novel Magidor-type forcing with intercoll & guide gen, incl. a proof of its charn of geny.
