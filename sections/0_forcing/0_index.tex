\chapter{Preliminaries}
\label{forcing}

We will cover the necessary background information for reading this thesis.
Mostly we cite well-known results, giving proof sketches or proofs when doing so facilitates better understanding.
In Section \ref{forcing:magidor} on Magidor forcing, we give more extensive proofs, as results are not as well known.

Results from Sections \ref{forcing:stat}, \ref{forcing:forcing}, \ref{forcing:ideals_measures}, and \ref{forcing:prikry} are largely found in \cite{jech_set_theory}. 
For forcing iterations in \ref{forcing:forcing}, we additionally draw from \cite{baumgartner_iterated_forcing}; 
for Section \ref{forcing:ideals_measures}, some material on ideals comes from \cite{foreman_ideals_gen_ees}; 
for Section \ref{forcing:mitchell}, we pull from \cite{mitchell_beginning_imt} for Mitchell rank and order; 
for Prikry with collapses in Section \ref{forcing:prikry}, we also cite \cite{cummings_prikry_slides};
and for Section \ref{forcing:magidor}, we appeal to Magidor's original paper \cite{magidor_chg_cof} and Fuchs' recent work in \cite{fuchs_magidor}.
