\section{Ideals, Measures, and Ultrapowers}
\label{forcing:ideals_measures}

% Define filters & ideals on cardinals, perhapse mention similar applies to other set algebras like []^{}, completeness, normality, saturation
% discuss ultrapowers, both inhouse & generic.
% maybe even some of the j() & ultrapower properties?

% Here would be a good place for Foreman duality, saturation, presaturation.
