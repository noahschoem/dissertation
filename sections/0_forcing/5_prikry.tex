\section{Singularizing Cardinals via Prikry Forcing}
\label{forcing:prikry}

While the L\'evy collapses $Col(\kappa,\lambda)$ and $Col(\kappa,<\lambda)$ require no large cardinal strength (or only an inaccessible), being able to singularize a cardinal without collapsing any cardinals by means of forcing requires a ground model with remnants of measurability, as shown by Jensen's Covering Lemma (c.f. \cite{jech_set_theory}, Chapter 18).
The first such forcing comes from work by Prikry.
A good summary can be found in \cite{jech_set_theory}, Chapter 21; as our results depend on generalizations of Prikry forcing, we summarize the salient points here.

\begin{definition}[Prikry forcing]
  Let $U$ be a normal measure on $\kappa$.
  Then we define the forcing $\mathbb{P}(U)$ by:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Conditions are of the form $(s,A)$ where $s\in [\kappa]^{<\omega}$ is strictly increasing, $A\in U$, and $\max(s)<\min(A)$
    \item The condition $(t,B)\leq (s,A)$ if $t\supseteq s$, $B\subseteq A$, and for all $\rho\in t\setminus s$, $\rho\in A$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

A generic filter $G$ induces an $\omega$-length sequence $\seq{\beta_n\mid n<\omega}$ cofinal below $\kappa$, given by 
\[
  \seq{\beta_n\mid n<\omega}=\bigcup_{(s,A)\in G} s
\]
Thus $\kappa$ is no longer measurable, as $\cf^{V[G]}(\kappa)=\omega$.
Remarkably, however, $\mathbb{P}(U)$ does not collapse cardinals, because the measure one components can decide the generic object's behavior.
We make this precise:

\begin{definition}[Direct and $n$-step extension]
  Let $(t,B)\leq (s,A)$.
  We say that $(t,B)$ is a \emph{direct extension} of $(s,A)$, written $(t,B)\leq^* (s,A)$, if $t=s$.
  
  And we say that $(t,B)$ is an $n$-\emph{step} extension of $(s,A)$ if $|t\setminus s|=n$.
\end{definition}

As $(s,A) \compat (s,B)$ for any $A,B$ (as $(s,A\cap B)=(s,A)\land (s,B)$), incompatibility is entirely characterized by the stem and so $\mathbb{P}(U)$ is $\kappa^+$-cc.

As for preservation of cardinals below $\kappa$\footnote{
  which is enough to show preservation of $\kappa$, as the limit of cardinals is also a cardinal
}, we use the fact that $\leq^*$ is quite powerful.

\begin{lemma}[Prikry property, open dense version]\thlabel{prikry_prikry_type_open_dense}
  Let $p\in\mathbb{P}(U)$, and let $D$ be an open dense subset of $\mathbb{P}(U)$.
  Then there is a $q\leq^* p$ and an $n<\omega$ such that every $n$-step extension of $q$ is in $D$.
\end{lemma}

Essentially, this follows from the normality of $U$.
As a corollary, direct extensions are sufficient to decide sentences in the forcing language:
\begin{corollary}[Prikry property, sentential version]
  Let $p\in\mathbb{P}(U)$ and let $\sigma$ be a sentence of the forcing language.
  Then there is an $r\leq^* p$ such that $r$ decides $\sigma$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
  Since the collection of all conditions deciding $\sigma$ is open dense, there is some $q\leq^* p$ and an $n$ such that every $n$-step extension of $q$ decides $\sigma$.
  
  But exactly one of $\sigma$ and $\lnot\sigma$ is forced measure-one often by the $n$-step extensions of $q$, so there is an $r\leq^* q$ such that every $n$-step extension of $r$ decides $\sigma$ the same way (the fleshed-out argument proceeds by induction on $n$). But then by density, $r$ must decide $\sigma$ that same way.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
  $\mathbb{P}(U)$ adds no bounded subsets of $\kappa$, and thus preserves cardinals.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
  Let $p\forces \dot{X}\subseteq \tau$ for some $\tau<\kappa$.
  For each $\alpha<\tau$, there is some $p_\alpha \leq^* p$ deciding $``\alpha\in\dot{X}"$; then since $U$ is $\kappa$-complete, the greatest lower bound $q$ of $\seq{p_\alpha \mid \alpha<\tau}$ suffices to define $\dot{X}$ entirely within $V$.
\end{proof}

Prikry forcing is a key ingredient in proving the consistency of the failure of the Singular Cardinals Hypothesis, which follows from larger cardinals than a single measurable:

\begin{fact}
  Let $\kappa$ be supercompact.
  Then after forcing to make $\kappa$ measurable such that $2^\kappa>\kappa^+$ and singularizing $\kappa$ with Prikry forcing, $SCH$ fails at $\kappa$.
\end{fact}

The argument is originally due to Magidor; subsequent work by Gitik, Woodin, and Mitchell across several papers showed that the large cardinal hypothesis of $\kappa$ measurable with $o(\kappa)=\kappa^{++}$ is necessary and sufficient.

As we will generalize in Section \ref{forcing:magidor}, Prikry forcing admits a neat characterization of genericity, courtesy of Mathias in \cite{mathias_prikry_genericity_charn}:

\begin{proposition}
  If $\seq{\beta_n\mid n<\omega}$ is $\mathbb{P}(U)$-generic then for all $A\in U$, for cofinitely many $n$, $\beta_n\in A$.
  
  Conversely, suppose $\vec{\gamma}=\seq{\gamma_n\mid n<\omega}\in V^{\mathbb{P}(U)}$ is such that for every $A\in U$, for cofinitely many $n$, $\gamma_n\in A$.
  Let 
  \[
    H=\left\{(s,A)\mid s\text{ a finite initial segment of }\vec{\gamma}, \ A\in U,\text{ and }\forall n\geq lh(s) \ \gamma_n\in A\right\}
  \]
  Then $H$ is $\mathbb{P}(U)$-generic over $V$.
\end{proposition}

If one wishes to simultaneously singularize $\kappa$ while collapsing cardinals below to make $\kappa$ into $\aleph_\omega$, then one may adjust the definition of Prikry forcing to interleave collapses between the Prikry points.
To ensure a Prikry-type property as in \thref{prikry_prikry_type_open_dense}, one may use the technique of \emph{guiding generics}.
We will generalize this to uncountable cofinality in Section \ref{accessible_ms:at_aleph_omega_1}.

This particular forcing is well documented in \cite{cummings_prikry_slides}.

\begin{proposition}\thlabel{exists_guide_generic}
  Let $\kappa$ be measurable with normal measure $U$, let $j:V\to \Ult(V,U)$ be the measure embedding associated with $U$, and assume $GCH$.
  Then there is a $K\in V$ such that $K$ is $Col(\kappa^+,<j(\kappa))^{\Ult(V,U)}$-generic over $V$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Observe that there are at most $(2^\kappa)^V$-many antichains of $Col(\kappa^+,<j(\kappa))$ in the ultrapower; 
  this is since each such antichain is of the form $[f]$, where $f$ is a function with domain $\kappa$ such that for all $\alpha$, $f(\alpha)$ is an antichain of $Col(\alpha^+,<\kappa)$.
  
  Let $\seq{A_\beta \middle| \beta<2^\kappa}$ be a $V$-enumeration of all antichains of $Col(\kappa^+,<j(\kappa))$ in the ultrapower.
  By $GCH$, since $|j(\kappa)|=\kappa^+$, we have exactly $\kappa^+$-many antichains and since $Col(\kappa^+,<j(\kappa))$ is $\kappa+1$-closed and the ultrapower is closed under $\kappa$-sequences, we may iteratively build a descending chain $K'=\seq{p_\beta\middle| \beta<\kappa^+}$ such that for every maximal antichain $A_\beta$ in the ultrapower, $p_\beta\in A_\beta$ or is stronger than some condition in $A_\beta$.
  Then $K$, the upwards closure of $K'$, is as desired.
\end{proof}

With such $K$, we may define a Prikry-type forcing with interleaved collapses chosen from $K$:

\begin{definition}[Prikry with guided interleaved collapses]
  Let $U$ be a normal measure on $\kappa$, and let $K$ be as in \thref{exists_guide_generic}.
  Then we define $\mathbb{PC}(U)$ by:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Conditions are of the form $(s,c,A,C)$ where
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $s\in [\kappa]^{<\omega}$ is strictly increasing and $s(0)=\omega_1$
      \item $\max(s)<\min(A)$
      \item $dom(c)=dom(s)$, and for each $n<lh(s)-1$, $c(n)\in Col(s(n)^+,<s(n+1))$, and $c(lh(s)-1)\in Col(s(lh(s)-1)^+,<\kappa)$
      \item $C$ is a function with domain $A$, $C(\rho)\in Col(\rho^+,<\kappa)$ for each $\rho\in A$, and $[C]_U\in K$
    \end{itemize}
    \item We say $(s',c',A',C')\leq (s,c,A,C)$ if 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $s'\subseteq s$
      \item for each $n<lh(s)$, $c'(n)\leq c(n)$ in the relevant collapse forcing
      \item for each $n\in [lh(s),lh(s'))$, $s'(n)\in A$ and $\sup(c(n))<s'(n)$
      \item $A'\subseteq A$
      \item $[C']\leq [C]$
    \end{itemize}
    In the case that $s'=s$, we say $(s',c',A',C')\leq^* (s,c,A,C)$.
      
    In the case that $|s'|=|s|+n$, we say that $(s',c',A',C')$ is an $n$-step extension of $(s,c,A,C)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Conditions with the same $s$ need not be compatible due to their collapse terms being incompatible.
However, the use of the guiding generic still grants us a Prikry-type property:
\begin{lemma}
  For every $p\in\mathbb{PC}(U)$ and every dense set $D$ there is a $q\leq^* p$ and an $n$ such that every $n$-step extension of $q$ is in $D$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary}
  Let $G$ be $\mathbb{PC}(U)$-generic over $V$ and let
  \[
    \seq{\beta_n\mid n<\omega}=\bigcup_{(s,c,A,C)\in G}s
  \]
  Then each $\beta_n$ and $\beta_n^+$ is preserved, as are all cardinals $\geq \kappa$.
  
  Further, for every $\rho\in [\beta_n^+,\beta_{n+1}]$ for some $n$, $|\rho|^{V[G]}=\beta_n^+$;
  hence $\kappa=(\aleph_\omega)^{V[G]}$.
\end{corollary}

A proof is outlined in \cite{cummings_prikry_slides}.

Similar to Prikry forcing, we get the following generic object:

\begin{proposition}
  Let $G$ be $\mathbb{PC}(U)$-generic over $V$; let 
  \[
    \seq{\beta_n\mid n<\omega}=\bigcup_{(s,c,A,C)\in G}s
  \]
  and for each $n$ let
  \[
    F_n=\left\{c(n) \mid \exists s,A,C \ (s,c,A,C)\in G \text{ and }n\in dom(c)\right\}
  \]
  Then
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item for all $A\in U$, for cofinitely many $n$, $\beta_n\in A$
    \item $F_n$ is $Col(\beta_n^+,<\beta_{n+1})$-generic over $V$ and if $C\in V$ with $[C]\in K$, then for cofinitely many $n$, $C(\beta_n)\in F_n$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

Conversely:
\begin{proposition}
  Work in $V^{\mathbb{PC}(U)}$; let $\vec{\gamma}=\seq{\gamma_n\mid n<\omega}$ be a strictly increasing sequence with limit $\kappa$ such that for each $A\in U$, for cofinitely many $n$, $\gamma_n\in A$.
  Let $G_n$ be $Col(\gamma_n^+,<\gamma_{n+1})$-generic over $V$ such that for all $C\in V$ with $[C]\in K$, for cofinitely many $n$, $C(\gamma_n)\in G_n$.
  
  Let
  \[
    H=\left\{(s,c,A,C)\in\mathbb{PC}(U) \middle| 
    \begin{array}{l}
      \forall n<lh(s) \ s(n)=\gamma_n\text{ and }c(n)\in G_n,\\
      \text{ and }\forall n\geq lh(s) \ \gamma_n\in A\text{ and }C(\gamma_n)\in G_n\\    
    \end{array}
    \right\}
  \]
  Then $H$ is $\mathbb{PC}(U)$-generic over $V$.
\end{proposition}

The proof is essentially the argument found in \cite{sinapova_unger_combos}.
