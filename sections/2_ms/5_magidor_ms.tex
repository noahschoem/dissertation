\section{Mutual Stationarity for Magidor Generics}
\label{ms:magidor_gens}


We now generalize Koepke's approach to Magidor forcing.
Before we do so, we have an ancillary lemma that will come into play.
Note that Prikry forcing preserves the stationarity of sets of size less than $\kappa$, because Prikry forcing adds no new bounded subsets of $\kappa$.
We need a different argument for Magidor forcing.

For this section, let $\vec{U}=\seq{U_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda}$ be a Mitchell order increasing sequence of normal measures on $\kappa$ of length $\lambda$, for some $\lambda<\kappa$.
Recall that $V^{\mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)}$ denotes a generic extension after forcing with $\mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)$, as defined in Section \ref{forcing:forcing}.

\begin{lemma}\thlabel{mag_forcing_preserves_stationary_successors}
  Let $\delta$ be a cardinal in $V$, let and suppose that in $V^{\mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)}$, 
  $\seq{\kappa_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda}$ denotes the Magidor generic sequence added by $\mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)$.
  Suppose that $\delta=\kappa_{\alpha+1}$ for some $\alpha$.
  Let $S\subseteq \delta$ be stationary in $V$.
  Then $S$ is stationary in $V^{\mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  It is enough to show that $S$ is stationary after forcing with $\mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)_{(\alpha+1,\delta)}\times \mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)^{(\alpha+1,\delta)}$.
  
  To see that $S$ is stationary in $V^{\mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)_{(\alpha+1,\delta)}}$, let $1\leq n<\omega$ be such that $\alpha+1=\beta+n$ for some $\beta$ limit (or $0$).
  Then densely often (by extending the stem such that $\beta+k$ is in the domain of the stem, for all $k\leq n$),
  we may assume we're forcing with $\mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)_{(\beta,\xi)}$ for some $\xi$, which is $\xi^+$-cc, and hence is $\delta$-cc as well.
  Thus $S$ is stationary in $V^{\mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)_{(\alpha+1,\delta)}}$.
  
  Since the direct extension order on $\mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)^{(\alpha+1,\delta)}$ remains $\delta$-closed after forcing with $\mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)_{(\alpha+1,\delta)}$, $S$ remains stationary in the full generic extension.
\end{proof}

Note that since mutually stationary sequences of sets are only defined for families of regular cardinals, we don't have to concern ourselves with sets cofinal in the cardinals singularized by the Magidor forcing.

\begin{theorem}\thlabel{magidor_generics_mutually_hom}
  Let $\lambda<\kappa$ and let $G$ be Magidor generic over $V$ with $\seq{\kappa_{\alpha}\mid \alpha<\lambda}$ the induced Magidor generic sequence.
  In $V[G]$, let $f:[\kappa]^{<\omega}\to\kappa$.
  
  Then there are $\delta<\lambda$ and $\seq{A_\alpha \mid \delta < \alpha < \lambda, \alpha \text{ successor}}$ such that each $A_\alpha$ is stationary in $\kappa_\alpha$
  and on which $f$ is mutually homogeneous,
  that is, whenever $x,y\subseteq [\bigcup_{\delta<\alpha<\lambda} A_\alpha]^{<\omega}$ with $type(x)=type(y)$ and $x\cap (f(x)+1)=y\cap(f(x)+1)$, we have that $f(x)=f(y)$.
  
  Moreover, each $A_\alpha\in r_\alpha^\lambda(\kappa_\alpha)$, where $r_\alpha^\lambda(\kappa_\alpha)$ is a Mitchell-rank $\alpha$ measure on $\kappa_\alpha$ and $r$ is the coherent system of representatives for $\seq{U_\alpha\mid \alpha<\lambda}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Work in $V$; let $(g,H)\forces \dot{f}:[\kappa]^{<\omega}\to\kappa$.
  For each stem $g'$ extending $g$, and each $x\in[\kappa]^{<\omega}$ strictly increasing with $\min(x)>\max ran(g)$, let $F(g',x)$ be defined by
  \[
    F(g',x)=\begin{cases}
      \beta & \exists E \ (g',E)\forces \dot{f}(x)=\beta \\
      \emptyset & \text{otherwise} \\
    \end{cases}
  \]
  
  Since $\vec{U}$ is a family of normal measures on $\kappa$,  applying \thref{simult_indisc_useful} to $F$ yields a family $X\in \prod_{\max dom(g)<\alpha<\lambda} U_\alpha$ of order indiscernibles for $F$.
  What that precisely means is that 
  whenever $g_1$, $g_2$ are finite extensions of $g$ with the same domain such that, above $\max dom(g)$, $g_i\upharpoonright (\max dom(g),\lambda)=\seq{\kappa^i_{\alpha_0},\dots,\kappa^i_{\alpha_n}}$ such that each $\kappa^i_{\alpha_j}\in X(\alpha_j)$, and $x_1$, $x_2$ are in $[\kappa]^{<\omega}$ with $\min(x_i)>\max ran(g)$ such that $x_i=\seq{x^i_{\beta_0},\dots,x^i_{\beta_{m}}}$ where $x^i_{\beta_j}\in X(\beta_j)$, and $x_1$ bears the same order relations to $ran(g_1)$ as $x_2$ bears to $ran(g_2)$, and $(ran(g_1)\cup x_1)\cap (F(g_1,x_1)+1)=(ran(g_2) \cup x_2)\cap (F(g_1,x_1)+1)$\footnote{
    Recall that $x\cap (h(x)+1)=y\cap (h(x)+1)$ amounts to saying that $h(x)<\min (x\Delta y)$, so amounts to asserting that $h$ is regressive on an appropriate subcollection of $\kappa$.
  }, then $F(g_1,x_1)=F(g_2,x_2)$.
  We may further constrain $X$ so that for $\beta>\max dom(g)$, $X(\beta)\subseteq H(\beta)$.
  
  Let $Y$ with $dom(Y)=dom(X)$ be such that for $\beta<\max dom(g)$, $Y(\beta)=H(\beta)$; and for $\beta>\max dom(g)$, $Y(\beta)$ is the collection of stationary reflection points in each $X(\beta)$, i.e. 
  \[
    Y(\beta)=X(\beta) \cap \{\gamma<\kappa \mid \gamma \cap X(\beta) \text{ stationary in }\gamma\}
  \]
  For each $\beta>\max dom(g)$, $Y(\beta)\in U_\beta$; this is a consequence of the fact that the collection of stationary reflection points below a measurable cardinal is measure one.
  Thus $(g,Y)$ is in fact a condition.
  
  We wish to verify that $(g,Y)$ forces the desired property for $\dot{f}$; by the Generic Model Theorem, it suffices to show the desired property is true in $V[G]$ whenever $(g,Y)\in G$.
  Let $G$ be $\mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)$-generic over $V$ with $(g,Y)\in G$; let $\vec{\kappa}=\seq{\kappa_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda}$ be the $G$-generic Magidor sequence.
  This buys for us that for all $\alpha<\lambda$ with $\alpha>\max dom(g)$, $\kappa_\alpha\in Y(\alpha)$.
  Let $\delta=\max dom(g)$ and let $\seq{A_\alpha \mid \delta<\alpha<\lambda, \alpha\text{ successor}}$ be given by $A_\alpha=X(\alpha) \cap \kappa_\alpha$.
  Each $A_\alpha$ is $V$-stationary in $\kappa_\alpha$ since $\kappa_\alpha\in Y(\alpha)$, and by \thref{mag_forcing_preserves_stationary_successors}, $A_\alpha$ remains stationary in $\kappa_\alpha$.
  
  From here on out, unless otherwise noted, we work in $V[G]$.
  We will verify that \\
  $\seq{A_\alpha \mid \delta<\alpha<\lambda, \alpha\text{ successor}}$ witnesses the desired conclusion.
  
  Suppose $x,y\subseteq \left[\bigcup_{\delta<\alpha<\lambda, \ \alpha\text{ successor}}A_\alpha\right]^{<\omega}$ are such that $type(x)=type(y)$ and $x\cap (\dot{f}[G](x)+1)=y\cap(\dot{f}[G](x)+1)$.
  Let $\beta$ be least such that $x,y\subseteq \kappa_\beta$; since $x$, $y$ finite, we have that $\beta=\alpha+1$ for some $\alpha$.
  Furthermore, since $x,y$ are finite, $type(x)=type(y)$, and 
  $x\cap (\dot{f}[G](x)+1)=y\cap(\dot{f}[G](x)+1)$, we may extend $(g,Y)$ to some $(g',Y')\in G$ such that:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\beta\in dom(g')$ and $g'(\beta)=\kappa_\beta$
    \item since $lh(x)=lh(y)=n$, if we write $x=\seq{x_i\mid i<n}$ and $y=\seq{y_i\mid i<n}$ in increasing order, then for each $i$ such that $x_i,y_i<\kappa_\alpha$,
    there exists some $\gamma\in dom(g')$ such that $x_i,y_i\in (\kappa_\gamma,\kappa_{\gamma+1})$
    \item $(g',Y')$ decides the values of both $\dot{f}(x)$ and $\dot{f}(y)$
  \end{itemize}
  
  But $type(x)=type(y)$, and $\min(x)$ and $\min(y)$ are both above $\kappa_\delta$.
  Thus $x$ bears the exact same order relations to the elements of $ran(g')$ as does $y$.
  Furthermore, since $x\cap (\dot{f}[G](x)+1)=y\cap(\dot{f}[G](x)+1)$ is true in $V[G]$, we have that $(ran(g') \cup x)\cap (F(g',x)+1)=(ran(g') \cup y) \cap(F(g',x)+1)$ in $V$.
  Since $x$, $y$, and $g'\upharpoonright (\delta,\lambda)$ were all picked from $X$, by choice of $X$ we have that $F(g',x)=F(g',y)$.
  
  But then by definition of $F(g',x)$ and $F(g',y)$, without loss of generality there is some $E$ such that 
  $(g',E)\forces \dot{f}(x)=F(g',x)=F(g',y)=\dot{f}(y)$.
  While $(g',E)$ is not necessarily in $G$, we have that $(g',E) \compat (g',Y')$ and both $(g',E)$ and $(g',Y')$ decide the values of $\dot{f}(x)$ and $\dot{f}(y)$.
  But then by compatibility, $(g',E)$ and $(g',Y')$ must decide the values of $\dot{f}(x)$ and $\dot{f}(y)$ the same way, and so $(g',Y')\forces \dot{f}(x)=\dot{f}(y)$.
  But then $(g',Y')\in G$ so $V[G]\models f(x)=f(y)$.
\end{proof}

\thref{magidor_generics_mutually_hom} gives a per-function mutual homogeneity on a tail of the Magidor generic sequence, but to achieve mutual stationarity, we need a uniform version.
Fortunately, \thref{magidor_generics_mutually_hom} can be uniformized below a single condition, which then forces that the entire Magidor sequence is mutually Ramsey.
This isn't particular to the complexities of mutual homogeneity or Ramseyness, but rather arises from the forcing apparatus itself:

\begin{lemma}\thlabel{magidor_generics_uniform_hom}
  There is a single $p\in\mathbb{MC}\left(\vec{U}\right)$ such that 
  \[
    p\forces ``\dot{\seq{\kappa_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda, \ \alpha\text{ successor}}} \text{ is mutually Ramsey as witnessed by } \check{A_\alpha}\in r_\alpha^\lambda\left(\dot{\kappa_\alpha}\right)"
  \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  For the sake of contradiction, suppose otherwise.
  By unpacking the definitions of $\not\forces$ and of mutually Ramsey, we have that below every $p$ there is a $q$ such that 
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{alignedat}{3}\label{bad_condition}
      q & \forces && ``\exists \dot{f}:[\kappa]^{<\omega}\to \kappa \ \text{for which there is no family of }\check{A_\alpha}\in r_\alpha^\lambda\left(\dot{\kappa_\alpha}\right) \text{ on successors} \\
      & && \text{witnessing mutual homogeneity for }f  "
    \end{alignedat}
  \end{equation}
  Without loss of generality, each such $q$ has a name $\dot{f}_q$ such that $q$ forces $\dot{f}_q$ to witness the criterion in \ref{bad_condition}.
  
  By choosing a maximal antichain $A$ of such $q$ and then by applying the Mixing Lemma to $\seq{f_q \mid q\in A}$, there is a name $\dot{g}$ such that 
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{alignedat}{3}\label{bad_condition_at_1}
      1_{\mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)} & \forces && ``\dot{g}:[\kappa]^{<\omega}\to \kappa \ \text{admits no family of }\check{A_\alpha}\in r_\alpha^\lambda\left(\dot{\kappa_\alpha}\right) \text{ on successors} \\
      & && \text{witnessing mutual homogeneity for }\dot{g}"
    \end{alignedat}
  \end{equation}
  But then by the argument of \thref{magidor_generics_mutually_hom}, since $stem\left(1_{\mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)}\right)=\emptyset$, 
  there is a condition $(\emptyset,Y)$ such that
  \[
    (\emptyset,Y)\forces ``\exists \dot{A_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda \text{ successor}}, \ A_\alpha\in r_\alpha^\lambda\left(\dot{\kappa_\alpha}\right), \ \text{ that is mutually homogeneous for }g"
  \]
  This contradicts \ref{bad_condition_at_1}.  
\end{proof}

Due to \thref{magidor_geometric_cofinite_meet}, we can adjust our Magidor generic sequence on a finite set to meet whatever condition we want, including the $p$ from \thref{magidor_generics_uniform_hom}:

\begin{lemma}\thlabel{magidor_is_hom_forcing}
  Let $q\in \mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)$, and let $G$ be $\mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)$-generic over $V$.
  Then there is a $G'$ also $\mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)$-generic over $V$ such that $q\in G'$ and $V[G]=V[G']$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $q=(g,H)$, and let $\seq{\kappa_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda}$ be the Magidor generic sequence induced by $G$. 
  By \thref{magidor_geometric_cofinite_meet}, there exists a finite $b\subseteq dom(H)$ such that for all $\alpha \in dom(H)\setminus b$, $\kappa_\alpha\in H(\alpha)$.
  Thus, let $q'=(g',H')$ be a $b$-step extension of $q$ such that for all $\alpha\in dom(H')$, $\kappa_\alpha\in H'(\alpha)$.
  
  Then let $\seq{\kappa'_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda}$ be given by $\kappa'_\alpha=g'(\alpha)$ if $\alpha\in dom(g)$, and $\kappa'_\alpha=\kappa_\alpha$ otherwise.
  Since $\seq{\kappa_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda}$ is geometric, so is $\seq{\kappa'_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda}$, 
  and so by \thref{magidor_geometric_iff_generic}, let $G'$ be the generic filter induced by $\seq{\kappa'_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda}$.
  
  By construction of $G'$, $q'\in G'$ since $\seq{\kappa'_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda} \upharpoonright dom(g')=g'$ and for all $\alpha\in dom(H')$, $\kappa'_\alpha\in H'(\alpha)$. Thus $q\in G'$ as $q'\leq q$.
  But since $\seq{\kappa_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda}$ and $\seq{\kappa'_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda}$ differ only on a finite subsequence, both are equidefinable from each other and therefore $V[G']=V[G]$.
\end{proof}

As a consequence, we have that Magidor generic sequences are mutually Ramsey on a \emph{cofinite} set:

\begin{theorem}\thlabel{magidor_generics_mr_cofinite}
  Let $G$ be $\mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)$-generic over $V$, and let $\seq{\kappa_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda}$ be its induced generic sequence.
  Then there is a cofinite subset $K$ of $\{\alpha<\lambda \mid \alpha\text{ successor}\}$ such that $\seq{\kappa_\alpha \mid \alpha\in K}$ is mutually Ramsey as witnessed by a family of $A_\alpha \in r_\alpha^\lambda(\kappa_\alpha)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $p\in \mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)$ be as in \thref{magidor_generics_uniform_hom},
  and by \thref{magidor_is_hom_forcing}, let $G'$ be generic such that $p\in G'$ and $V[G]=V[G']$.
  
  Then by \thref{magidor_generics_uniform_hom}, the $V[G']$-generic sequence $\seq{\kappa'_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda}$ is mutually Ramsey on the $\kappa'_\alpha$ for which $\alpha$ is a successor, as witnessed by elements of $r_\alpha^\lambda(\kappa'_\alpha)$.
  
  But by the proof of \thref{magidor_is_hom_forcing}, $\seq{\kappa_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda}$ and $\seq{\kappa_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda}$ agree on a cofinite subsequence $K'$.
  Then $K=K'\cap \{\alpha \in Ord \mid \alpha \text{ successor}\}$ is as desired.
\end{proof}

As for Prikry generics, (c.f. \thref{prikry_generic_ramseyness_implies_ms}), from the mutual Ramseyness we obtain mutual stationarity:

\begin{theorem}\thlabel{magidor_generics_ms_cofinite}
  Let $G$ be $\mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)$-generic over $V$, let $\seq{\kappa_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda}$ be its induced generic sequence, and let $K$ be as in \thref{magidor_generics_mr_cofinite}.
  Then
  \[
    MS(\seq{\kappa_\alpha \mid \kappa_\alpha\in K})
  \]
  holds.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $\seq{S_\alpha \mid \alpha\in K}$ be a system of stationary sets with each $S_\alpha\subseteq \kappa_\alpha$, let $\mathcal{M}$ be a structure $\kappa$ with countable signature and with Skolem function $F$.
  Since $\mathcal{M}$ has only countably many functions in its signature, let $\seq{A_\alpha \mid \alpha\in K}$ be mutually homogeneous for $\mathcal{M}$ and $F$ with each $A_\alpha$ stationary in $\kappa_\alpha$.
  
  For each relevant $\alpha$, since $Lim(A_\alpha)$ is club in $\kappa_\alpha$ let $\gamma_\alpha\in S_\alpha \cap Lim(A_\alpha)$, and let
  \[
    \mathcal{U}=F"\left[\bigcup_{\delta<\alpha<\kappa, \ \alpha\text{ successor}} A_\alpha \cap \gamma_\alpha\right]^{<\omega}
  \]
  Then since $F$ is a Skolem function, $\mathcal{U}\prec \mathcal{M}$, and by the exact same logic as in \thref{prikry_generic_ramseyness_implies_ms}, for each relevant $\alpha$, $\sup(\mathcal{U}\cap \kappa_\alpha)=\gamma_\alpha$ for every $\alpha\in K$.
\end{proof}
