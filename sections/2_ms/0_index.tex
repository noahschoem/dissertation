\chapter{Mutual Stationarity}
\label{ms}

Foreman and Magidor first introduced mutual stationarity in \cite{foreman_magidor_ns_ns} to argue for the non-saturation of certain nonstationary ideals.
Mutual stationarity generalizes stationarity to singular cardinals, and leads to interesting avenues of study in its own right.
We will define mutual stationarity and summarize prior results, and contribute a mutual stationarity property for Magidor generic sequences.
