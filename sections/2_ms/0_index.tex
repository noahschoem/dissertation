\chapter{Mutual Stationarity}
\label{ms}

Foreman and Magidor first introduced mutual stationarity in \cite{foreman_magidor_ns_ns} to argue for the non-saturation of certain nonstationary ideals.
Mutual stationarity generalizes stationarity to singular cardinals, and leads to interesting avenues of study in its own right.
We will first define mutual stationarity and summarize prior results, with additional commentary and detail.
This section culminates in the following mutual stationarity property for Magidor generic sequences: that if $\seq{\kappa_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda}$ is a Magidor generic sequence for some $\lambda<\kappa$ over some $V$, then there is a cofinite subset of the Magidor generic sequence $K$ such that any family $S_\alpha\subseteq\kappa_\alpha\in K$ of statioary sets is mutually stationary.
We spell this out in Section \ref{ms:magidor_gens}, with the core results being \thref{magidor_generics_ms_cobounded} and \thref{magidor_generics_ms_cofinite}.
