\section{Down to $\aleph_{\omega_1}$}
\label{accessible_ms:at_aleph_omega_1}

To achieve mutual stationarity properties at accessible cardinals of uncountable cofinality, we develop a forcing that will simultaneously singularize a cardinal $\kappa$ and collapse cardinals below to make $\kappa$ the new $\aleph_{\omega_1}$.

This is ongoing work, and a first proof of concept would be to achieve $MS(\seq{\aleph_{2n+3}\middle| n<\omega}\frown \seq{\aleph_{\alpha+2n}\middle| \omega\leq\alpha<\omega_1,n<\omega};\omega_1)$.

While we have not achieved this, we have developed an as of yet unpublished Magidor-like forcing that singularizes $\kappa$ and collapses below to make $\kappa$ into $\aleph_{\omega_1}$.

As an additional result, we state and partially prove a characterization of genericity for such forcing, along the lines of a diagonal Prikry forcing appearing in \cite{sinapova_unger_combos_aleph_omega} and \cite{fuchs_magidor}.

We fix $\vec{U}=\seq{U_\xi \middle| \xi<\lambda}$, $\lambda<\kappa$, $Y_\xi$, and $\seq{r_\beta^\alpha \middle| \beta<\alpha<\lambda}$ as in Section 1, with $\lambda\leq \omega_1$ a limit ordinal.

Suppose $GCH$; let $\seq{U_\gamma \middle| \gamma\leq \lambda}$ be a Mitchell order-increasing system of measures.
Work in $Ult(V,U_\lambda)$ and consider $Col(\kappa^+,<j_{U_\lambda}(\kappa))=[Col(\alpha^+,<\kappa)]_{U_\lambda}$.

\begin{lemma}\thlabel{big_guide_generic}
  There is a $K\in V$ which is $Col(\kappa^+,<j_{U_\lambda}(\kappa))$-generic over $Ult(V,U_\lambda)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Observe that there are at most $(2^\kappa)^V$-many antichains of $Col(\kappa^+,<j_{U_\lambda}(\kappa))$ in the ultrapower; 
  this is since each such antichain is of the form $[f]$, where $f$ is a function with domain $\kappa$ such that for all $\alpha$, $f(\alpha)$ is an antichain of $Col(\alpha^+,<\kappa)$.
  
  Let $\seq{A_\beta \middle| \beta<2^\kappa}$ be a $V$-enumeration of all antichains of $Col(\kappa^+,<j_{U_\lambda}(\kappa))$ in the ultrapower.
  By $GCH$, since $|j(\kappa)|=\kappa^+$, we have exactly $\kappa^+$-many antichains and since $Col(\kappa^+,<j_{U_\lambda}(\kappa))$ is $\kappa+1$-closed and the ultrapower is closed under $\kappa$-sequences, we may iteratively build a descending chain $K'=\seq{p_\beta\middle| \beta<\kappa^+}$ such that for every maximal antichain $A_\beta$ in the ultrapower, $p_\beta\in A_\beta$ or is stronger than some condition in $A_\beta$.
  Then $K$, the upwards closure of $K'$, is as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\thlabel{coherence_guiding_generic_family}
  Furthermore, for every $\alpha\leq\lambda$ there is a $K_\alpha\in V$ which is $Col(\kappa^+,<j_{U_\alpha}(\kappa))$-generic over $Ult(V,U_\alpha)$, such that:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item whenever $\alpha<\beta\leq \lambda$, $K_\alpha\in Ult(V,U_\beta)$
    \item there is a family of functions $\seq{k_\alpha^\beta\middle| \alpha<\beta<\lambda}$ such that $K_\alpha = [\eta \mapsto k^\beta_\alpha (\eta)]_{U_\beta}$
    \item \label{coherence_guiding_generic_family:refl} in particular, for some $Z_\beta\in U_\beta$, for every $\eta\in Z_\beta$, $k^\beta_\alpha(\eta)$ is a $Col(\eta^+,<j_{r^\beta_\alpha(\eta)}(\eta))$-generic over $Ult(V,r^\beta_\alpha(\eta))$  and $[K_\alpha \upharpoonright \eta]_{r^\beta_\alpha(\eta)}=k^\beta_\alpha(\eta)$; furthermore, this reflects downwards through $r$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  The existence of $K_\alpha$ can be argued exactly as in \thref{big_guide_generic}.
  
  As for obtaining that $K_\alpha\in Ult(V,U_\beta)$, observe that since $U_\alpha\in Ult(V,U_\beta)$ (and by $GCH$), we simply have that $\left| j_{U_\alpha}(\kappa) \right|^{Ult(V,U_\beta)}=2^\kappa=\kappa^+$ (by $\kappa^\kappa$ onto $j_{U_\alpha}(\kappa)$ by $f \mapsto [f]_{U_\alpha}$, see for instance \cite{jech_set_theory}, Chapter 17, for details).
  Furthermore, since $U_\alpha\in Ult(V,U_\beta)$, the entire family $\seq{A_\rho \middle| \rho<(2^\kappa)^{Ult(V,U_\alpha)}}$ of $Ult(V,U_\alpha)$-antichains of $Col(\kappa^+,<j_{U_\alpha}(\kappa))^{Ult(V,U_\alpha)}$ lives in $Ult(V,U_\beta)$, and there are only $\kappa^+$-many of them as witnessed in $Ult(V,U_\beta)$.
  Since $Ult(V,U_\beta)$ is closed under $\kappa$-sequences, the argument as in \thref{big_guide_generic} goes through in $Ult(V,U_\beta)$, but for $Col(\kappa^+,<j_{U_\alpha}(\kappa))$.
  
  The second and third items are measure-one reflections of the first.
\end{proof}

The above coherent family of ultrapower collapse-generics allows us to define a Magidor-style forcing with interleaved collapses, where the collapses are ``guided" by the ultrapower generics.
In summary, conditions will similar to Magidor forcing to add a sequence $\seq{\kappa_\alpha \middle| \alpha<\omega_1}$ with supremum $\kappa$, but:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\kappa_0$ will be the new $\aleph_3$,
  \item between any two adjacent Magidor points $\kappa_\alpha$ and $\kappa_{\alpha+1}$ we will also force with $Col(\kappa_\alpha^+,<\kappa_{\alpha+1})$,
  \item extension will be as in Magidor forcing, but additionally we may stregthen collapses, and we don't allow already-collapsed ordinals to become future Magidor points,
  \item when we add new points to the growing finite subfamily of the Magidor sequence, we must also carefully choose new collapse terms below and above,
  \item and the conditions are restricted in such a way as to ensure that no Magidor sequence point gets collapsed, and that the poset still has a Prikry-type property.
\end{itemize}

We define Magidor with interleaved collapses in full generality; for our purposes, we will later restrict $\lambda$ to be $\omega$ or $\omega_1$.
\begin{definition}
  $\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})$: conditions are of the form $(f,c,A,C)$ where:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $dom(f),dom(c)\in [\lambda\sqcup\{-1\}]^{<\omega}$, $dom(f)=dom(c)$, and $dom(A)=dom(C)=\lambda\setminus dom(f)$, and $f(-1)=\omega_1$. We will write $dom^+(f)$ to mean $dom(f)\cap Ord$, and similarly for $dom(c)$.
    \item For $\xi\in dom^+(f)$, $f(\xi)\in Z_\xi$, $f(\xi)>\lambda$, and $f$ is strictly increasing
    \item for $\xi\in dom(A)$ with $\xi<\max dom^+(f)$, let $\tau=\min\{dom^+(f)\setminus (\xi+1)\}$.
    Then $A(\xi)\in r^\tau_\xi(f(\tau))$.
    \item For $\xi\in dom(A)$ with $\xi>\max dom^+(f)$, $A(\xi)\in U_\xi$; with $\tau=\max (dom^+(f)\cap \xi)$, we further require that $A(\xi)\subseteq Z_\xi\setminus(f(\tau)+1)$.
    \item For each $\alpha \in dom(c)$, $c(\alpha)$, if $(dom(f)\setminus (\alpha+1))\neq\emptyset$, is a $Col(f(\alpha)^+,<f(\min(dom(f)\setminus (\alpha+1))))$-condition; otherwise is a $Col(f(\alpha)^+,<\kappa)$-condition
    \item for each $\alpha\in dom(A)$, for each $\beta\in dom(A)\cap \alpha$, $A(\alpha) \cap \sup c(\beta) = \emptyset$, that is, no collapsed ordinals will ever become Magidor points;
    \item $C$ acts as a measure-one system of future choices for $c$; that is, for each relevant $\alpha$, $C(\alpha)$ is a function with domain $A(\alpha)$ such that
    \begin{itemize}
      \item if $\delta\in A(\alpha)$, then $C(\alpha)(\delta)\in Col(\delta^+,<\kappa)$ if $\delta>\max dom(f)$; otherwise, letting $\xi=\min (dom(f)\setminus (\alpha+1))$, is in $Col(\delta^+,<f(\xi))$
      
      \item if $\alpha>\max dom(f)$, then $[C(\alpha)]_{U_\alpha}\in K_\alpha$; otherwise, letting $\xi=\min (dom(f)\setminus (\alpha+1))$, we have that $[C(\alpha)]_{r_\alpha^\xi(f(\xi))}\in k_\alpha^\xi(f(\xi))$.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
  
  We say that the condition $(f',c',A',C')\leq (f,c,A,C)$ if
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $f' \supseteq f$ and if $\alpha \in dom^+(f')\setminus dom^+(f)$, then $f'(\alpha)\in A(\alpha)$
    \item for each $\alpha \in dom(c)$, $c'(\alpha)\leq c(\alpha)$ in the relevant collapse forcing
    \item for each $\alpha \in dom^+(c')\setminus dom^+(c)$, $c'(\alpha) \leq C(\alpha)(f'(\alpha))$
    \item for all $\alpha \in dom(A')$, $A'(\alpha)\subseteq A(\alpha)$
    \item for all $\alpha \in dom(C')$, $C'(\alpha)(\delta)\leq C(\alpha)(\delta)$ for all $\delta\in A'(\alpha)$
    
  \end{enumerate}
  As for our definition of direct extension, we will say that $(f',c',A',C')\leq^* (f,c,A,C)$ if $f'=f$ (note that we may still strengthen collapse terms in a direct extension).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  For ease of notation, and in accordance with conventions found in \cite{gitik_prikry_type}, we may write a condition $p\in \mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})$ as
  \[
    p=(f^p,c^p,A^p,C^p)
  \]
  
  We'll say that the \emph{stem} of $p$ is $f^p$.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
  Let $p$ be a condition, let $\alpha \in dom(A^q)$, and let $\nu\in A^q(\alpha)$.
  Then we may define the condition $p\frown (\alpha,\nu)$ as the weakest extension $q$ of $p$ such $f^q(\alpha)=\nu$, namely:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $f^{p\frown (\alpha,\nu)}=f^p \frown (\alpha,\nu)$
    \item $c^{p\frown (\alpha,\nu)}=c^p \frown (\alpha,C^p(\alpha)(\nu))$
    \item For $\beta>\alpha$, $A^{p\frown (\alpha,\nu)}(\beta)=A^p(\beta)\setminus \sup(C^p(\alpha)(\nu))$ and $C^{p\frown (\alpha,\nu)}(\beta)=C^p(\beta) \upharpoonright A^{p\frown (\alpha,\nu)}(\beta)$
    \item For $\beta<\alpha$, $A^{p\frown (\alpha,\nu)}(\beta)=A^p(\beta)\cap \nu \cap \{\mu \in Z_\beta \cap \nu \mid \sup C^p(\beta)(\mu)<\nu\}$; by \thref{coherence_guiding_generic_family}(\ref{coherence_guiding_generic_family:refl}), this is in $r_\beta^\alpha(\nu)$
    \item and for $\beta<\alpha$, $C^{p\frown (\alpha,\nu)}(\beta)=C^p(\beta)\upharpoonright A^{p\frown (\alpha,\nu)}(\beta)$; by \thref{coherence_guiding_generic_family}(\ref{coherence_guiding_generic_family:refl}), $[C^{p\frown (\alpha,\nu)}(\beta)]_{r_\beta^\alpha(\nu)}\in k_\beta^\alpha(\nu)$ as needed
  \end{itemize}
  and we may define, for each $a\in [dom(A^p)]^{<\omega}$ and each strictly increasing $\vec{\nu}\in \prod_{\alpha\in a} A^p(\alpha)$, $p\frown \vec{\nu}$ similarly.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Let $a\in [\lambda\cup\{-1\}]^{<\omega}$, let $b\subseteq a \cup \{-1\}$, and let $p,q$ be conditions with $q\leq p$. We'll say that $q$ is an $a$-step extension of $p$ if $dom(f^q)=dom(f^p)\sqcup a$.
\end{definition}

%% TODO: poset combinatorics. MS in the generic extension.

Observe that $\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})$ has the $\kappa^+$-cc essentially for the same reasons as classical Magidor forcing.
Note that two conditions with the same Magidor stem need not be compatible due to their collapse terms being incompatible:

\begin{proposition}
  $\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})$ has the $\kappa^+$-cc.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Observe that if $p$, $q$ are conditions such that both $f^p=f^q$ and $c^p=c^q$, then $p \compat q$; simply strengthen $A^p$, $A^q$, $C^p$, $C^q$ accordingly. 
  Thus there are only $\kappa$-many choices of incompatible stems and collapses.
\end{proof}

% TODO: make more explicit; separate into a \thlabel-able remark or proposition, elaborate (i.e. say below any Magidor point etc), and \thref the vanilla M(U) version
\begin{remark}\thlabel{magidor_collapse_factoring}
  As with vanilla Magidor forcing (c.f. \thref{magidor_factoring}),
  due to our use of the reflected guiding generics $\seq{k_\alpha^\beta\middle| \alpha<\beta, \beta<\lambda}$, for each $\beta$ and each $\rho\in Y_\xi$, relative to the weakest $p$ for which $f^p(\beta)=\rho$, 
  \[
    \mathbb{MC}(\vec{U}) / p=\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})_{(\gamma,\delta)}\times\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})^{(\gamma,\delta)}
  \]
  so $\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})$ factors.
  Thus, as with $\mathbb{M}(\vec{U})$, many preservation arguments that work for $\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})$ still reflect downwards.
\end{remark}

The diagonalization lemma for $\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})$ requires more assumptions than with $\mathbb{M}(\vec{U})$; due to the introduction of collapse terms, not every indexed family of step extensions below $p$ can be diagonalized.

However, a Prikry-type property still holds, and through its proof we can extract a partial diagonalization lemma.
\begin{lemma}[Prikry-type lemma, open dense version]\thlabel{magidor_collapse_prikry_open_dense}
  If $p$ is a condition and $\mathcal{D}$ is an open dense set, then there is a direct extension $r\leq^* p$ and an $a\in [\lambda]^{<\omega}$ such that every $a$-step extension of $r$ is in $\mathcal{D}$.
  Furthermore, for every $b\in[\lambda]^{<\omega}$ for which $p$ admits $b$-step extensions, either every $b$-step extension of $p$ is in $\mathcal{D}$, or none are.
\end{lemma}

Before we prove this, we will introduce some terminology for families of direct extensions of a fixed condition:

\begin{definition}\thlabel{family_meets_dense_set_below}
  Let $p\in\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})$, let $\mathcal{D}$ be an open dense set, and let
  \[
    E=\left\{\vec{\nu}:a\to \kappa \middle| a\in [dom(A^p)]^{<\omega}, \vec{\nu}\in \prod_{\alpha\in a} A^p(\alpha),\text{ and }p\frown\vec{\nu}\text{ is a condition below }p\right\}
  \]
  and for each $a\in[\lambda]^{<\omega}$ such that there are valid $a$-step extensions of $p$, let 
  \[
    E_a=\{\vec{\nu}\in E \mid dom(\vec{\nu})=a\}
  \]
  Let $\seq{p_{\vec{\nu}}\middle| \vec{\nu}\in E_a\text{( or }E\text{)}}$ be an $E_a$ (or $E$)-indexed family of conditions.
  We say that such a family \emph{meets $\mathcal{D}$ below $p$ if possible} if for each $\vec{\nu}\in E_a$ (or $E$), $p_{\vec{\nu}}\leq^* p \frown \vec{\nu}$ and if there is some $r\leq^* p_{\vec{\nu}}$ such that $r\in\mathcal{D}$, then $p_{\vec{\nu}}\in\mathcal{D}$ as well.
\end{definition}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \thref{magidor_collapse_prikry_open_dense}]
  We proceed in a series of claims.
  Let $E$, and $E_a$ for each $a\in [dom(A^p)]^{<\omega}$, be as in \thref{family_meets_dense_set_below}; note that for each $\alpha\in dom(A^p)$, $E_{\{\alpha\}}=A^p(\alpha)$.
  
  \begin{claim}\thlabel{magidor_collapse_meets_dense_generic_one_step}
    For each $\alpha\in dom(A^p)$, there is a family $\seq{p_{(\alpha,\nu)} \middle| \nu\in A^p(\alpha)}$ that meets $\mathcal{D}$ below $p$ if possible such that
    \[
      [\nu\mapsto c^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(\alpha)] \in K_\alpha
    \]
    (or $k_\alpha^\beta(\rho)$ if applicable).
  \end{claim}
  \begin{proof}[Proof of \thref{magidor_collapse_meets_dense_generic_one_step}]
    Without loss of generality, we argue for $\alpha>\max dom(f^p)$; for smaller $\alpha$, due to \thref{magidor_collapse_factoring}, we may factor and work over $\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})_{(\alpha,f^p(\alpha))}$ and $\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})^{(\alpha,f^p(\alpha))}$.
    
    Let $\mathcal{D}^*\subseteq Col(\kappa^+,<j_{U_\alpha}(\kappa))^{Ult(V,U_\alpha)}$ be given by
    \[
      \mathcal{D}^*=\left\{[\nu\mapsto c^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(\alpha)]_{U_\alpha} \middle| \seq{p_{(\alpha,\nu)} \middle| \nu\in A^p(\alpha)}\text{ meets }\mathcal{D}\text{ below }p\text{ if possible} \right\}
    \]
    Then $\mathcal{D}^*$ is dense below $[C^p(\alpha)]$.
    To see this, let $[b]\in Col(\kappa^+,<j_{U_\alpha}(\kappa))^{Ult(V,U_\alpha)}$ be below $[C^p(\alpha)]$;
    simply because $[b]\leq [C^p(\alpha)]$, (on a measure one collection of $\nu\in A^p(\alpha)$) we may straightaway let $p_{(\alpha,\nu)}$ be such that $p_{(\alpha,\nu)}\leq^* p\frown (\alpha,\nu)$, $c^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(\alpha)\leq b(\nu)$, and if some $r\leq^* p_{(\alpha,\nu)}$ is in $\mathcal{D}$, then $p_{(\alpha,\nu)}$ is already chosen to be in $\mathcal{D}$.
    Then $\seq{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}\middle| \nu\in A^p(\alpha)}$ meets $\mathcal{D}$ below $p$ if possible and by construction, $[\nu\mapsto c^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(\alpha)]\leq[b]$.
    
    Thus by the genericity of $K_\alpha$, $\mathcal{D}^* \cap K_\alpha\neq\emptyset$ and therefore there is some $\seq{p_{(\alpha,\nu)} \middle| \nu\in A^p(\alpha)}$ that meets $\mathcal{D}$ below $p$ if possible such that $[\nu\mapsto c^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(\alpha)]_{U_\alpha}\in K_\alpha$.
  \end{proof}
  
  Having the family's collapse terms at $\alpha$ in $K_\alpha$ in the ultrapower allows us to diagonalize:
  
  \begin{claim}\thlabel{magidor_collapse_diagonalize_one_step}
    Let $\seq{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}\middle| \nu\in A^p(\alpha)}$ be as in \thref{magidor_collapse_meets_dense_generic_one_step}.
    Then there is a $p_\alpha\leq^* p$ such that $\seq{p_\alpha \frown (\alpha,\nu) \middle| \nu\in A^{p_\alpha}(\alpha)}$ meets $\mathcal{D}$ below $p$ if possible.
  \end{claim}
  
  \begin{proof}[Proof of \thref{magidor_collapse_diagonalize_one_step}]
    Without loss of generality, we argue for $p$ such that $f^p=\seq{(-1,\omega_1)}$; we can handle larger stems by factoring and measure one concentrations as per \thref{magidor_collapse_factoring}.
    In this reduced case, it suffices to define $A^{p_\alpha}$, $C^{p_\alpha}$, and $c^{p_\alpha}(-1)$.
    
    Observe that for each $\nu\in A^p(\alpha)$, $c^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(-1)\in Col(\omega_2,<\nu)$ which is of cardinality $\nu$.
    Thus we may view the map $\nu\mapsto c^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(-1)$ as a regressive map on $A^p(\alpha)$, and so by the normality of $U_\alpha$ and Fodor's Theorem, there is some $A'\in U_\alpha$, $A'\subseteq A^p(\alpha)$, and some $c'\in Col(\omega_2,<\kappa)$ such that for all $\nu\in A'$, $c^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(-1)=c'$.
    
    Let
    \[
      c^{p_\alpha}(-1)=c'
    \]
    
    For $\beta>\alpha$, observe that for each $\nu\in A'$, $[C^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(\beta)]_{U_\beta}\in K_\beta$, so we may extend $\{[C^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(\beta)]_{U_\beta} \mid \nu\in A'\}$ to some $\kappa$-sized downwards directed subset of $K_\beta$.
    Thus, by the $\kappa^+$-distributvity $Col(\kappa^+,<j_{U_\beta}(\kappa))^{Ult(V,U_\beta)}$, we may find some $[C']$ such that $[C']_{U_\beta}\leq [C^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(\beta)]_{U_\beta}$ as witnessed by $W_\nu\in U_\beta$, for all $\nu\in A'$
    \footnote{
      This is a widely applicable forcing result: let $\mathbb{P}$ be $\kappa^+$-distributive, let $G$ be $\mathbb{P}$-generic, and let $\seq{p_\alpha \mid \alpha<\kappa}$ be a downwards directed subset of $G$.
      Then there is a $p\in G$ that is a lower bound of $\seq{p_\alpha \mid \alpha<\kappa}$.
      To see this, note that by distributivity, $\seq{p_\alpha \mid \alpha<\kappa}$ is in the ground model and $D:=\{q \mid \forall \alpha \ q\leq p_\alpha\text{ or }\exists \alpha \ p\perp p_\alpha\}$ is dense.
      Let $p\in D \cap G$. Since each $p_\alpha \in G$, $p\compat p_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$ and thus $p\leq p_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$.
    }.
    We let
    \[
      A^{p_\alpha}(\beta)=A' \cap \Delta_{\nu\in A'} W_\nu
    \]
    and let 
    \[
      C^{p_\alpha}(\beta) = C' \upharpoonright A^{p_\alpha}(\beta)
    \]
    
    For $\beta<\alpha$, recall that each $A^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(\beta)\in r_\beta^\alpha(\nu)$, and each $C^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(\beta)$ is a map with domain $A^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(\beta)$ such that
    \begin{itemize}
      \item for each $\mu\in A^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(\beta)$, $C^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(\beta)(\mu)\in Col(\mu^+,<\nu)$
      \item $[C^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(\beta)]_{r_\beta^\alpha(\nu)}\in k_\beta^\alpha(\nu)$
    \end{itemize}
    Let $B_{\beta,\alpha}=[\nu\mapsto A^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(\beta)]_{U_\alpha}\in U_\beta$ and
    let $X_{\beta,\alpha}=[\nu\mapsto C^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(\beta)]_{U_\alpha}$.
    By elementarity and the measure coherence, ${B_{\beta,\alpha}\in U_\beta}$;
    by the guiding generic coherence of \thref{coherence_guiding_generic_family},  $[X_{\beta,\alpha}]_{U_\beta}\in K_\beta$.
    
    So let $F_{\beta,\alpha}$ be a $U_\alpha$-measure-one collection of $\nu\in A'$ such that
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $B_{\beta,\alpha} \cap \nu = A^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(\beta)$
      \item $X_{\beta,\alpha} \upharpoonright A^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(\beta) = C^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(\beta)$
    \end{itemize}
    Let
    \[
      A^{p_\alpha}(\beta)=B_{\beta,\alpha} \cap A^p(\alpha)
    \]
    and let
    \[
      C^{p_\alpha}(\beta)=X_{\beta,\alpha}\upharpoonright A^{p_\alpha}(\beta)
    \]
    We will need $F_{\beta,\alpha}$ for the next case.
    
    For $\beta=\alpha$, by the result of \thref{magidor_collapse_meets_dense_generic_one_step}, $[\nu\mapsto c^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(\alpha)]_{U_\alpha}\in K_\alpha$ so let $C''$ be such that $[C'']=[\nu\mapsto c^{p_{(\alpha,\nu)}}(\alpha)]$ and let $A''$ be a measure one set witnessing this equality.
    
    Let
    \[
      A^{p_\alpha}(\alpha)=A'' \cap A' \cap \bigcap_{\beta<\alpha} F_{\beta,\alpha}
    \]
    This ensures that for every $\nu\in A^{p_\alpha}(\alpha)$, $(p_\alpha \frown (\alpha,\nu))\upharpoonright \alpha$ behaves as described above.
    
    Let
    \[
      C^{p_\alpha}(\alpha)=C''
    \]
    
    Then $p_\alpha$ is as desired.
  \end{proof}
  
  \begin{claim}\thlabel{magidor_collapse_diagonalize_all_step}
    For all $a\in [dom(A^p)]^{<\omega}$, there is a $p_a\leq^* p$ such that 
    \[
      \seq{p_a\frown \vec{\nu} \middle| p_a\frown \vec{\nu}\text{ is a valid condition}}
    \]
    meets $\mathcal{D}$ below $p$ if possible.
  \end{claim}
  
  \begin{proof}[Proof of \thref{magidor_collapse_diagonalize_all_step}]
    We induct on $|a|$; \thref{magidor_collapse_meets_dense_generic_one_step} and \thref{magidor_collapse_diagonalize_one_step} show how to find such $p_a$ for $|a|=1$.
    
    As for the induction, suppose without loss of generality that $f^p=\seq{(-1,\omega_1)}$ as before;
    suppose the above statement is true for every $a$ with $|a|=n$.
    Let $\alpha=\min(a)$ and let $b=a\setminus \{\alpha\}$.
    Then by the induction hypothesis, for (measure one many) $\mu\in A^p(\alpha)$, there is some $q_\mu\leq^* p \frown (\alpha,\mu)$ such that 
    \[
      \seq{ q_\mu \frown \vec{\nu} \middle| q_\mu \frown \vec{\nu} \text{ is a valid condition}}
    \]
    meets $\mathcal{D}$ below $p$ if possible. 
    By the same argument as in \thref{magidor_collapse_meets_dense_generic_one_step}, we may assume that $[\mu\mapsto c^{q_\mu}(\alpha)\mid \alpha\in A^p(\alpha)]_{U_\alpha}\in K_\alpha$, 
    and thus by the same argument as in \thref{magidor_collapse_diagonalize_one_step}, we have some $q\leq^* p$ such that $q\frown (\alpha,\mu)\leq^* q_\mu$ whenever $\mu\in A^q(\alpha)$ and $\seq{q\frown (\alpha,\mu) \middle| \mu\in A^q(\alpha)}$ meets $\mathcal{D}$ below $p$ if possible\footnote{
      Note that the same Fodor's Theorem argument works to concentrate $A^{q}(\alpha)$ so that for every $\mu\in A^q(\alpha)$, the map $\mu\mapsto c^{q_\mu}(-1)\in Col(\omega_2,<\mu)$ is constant.
    }.
    
    But then by construction, $\seq{q\frown \vec{\nu} \middle| \vec{\nu}\in E_a}$ meets $\mathcal{D}$ below $p$ if possible, and so $q$ is our desired $p_a$.
  \end{proof}
  
  By enumerating over all $a$ for which $p$ has valid $a$-step extensions (that is, $a\in [dom(A^p)]^{<\omega}$), 
  we may additionally construct the $\seq{q_a \mid a\in [dom(A^p)]^{<\omega}}$ such that for each $\alpha\in dom(f^p)$, $\{c^{q_a}(\alpha)\mid a\in [dom(A^p)]^{<\omega}\}$ forms a directed system in the relevant collapse forcing of size less than $\lambda^+$.
  
  Therefore, by invoking the $\lambda^+$-closure of each relevant measure
  to shrink the measure terms $A^{q_a}$,
  the $\lambda^+$-directed closure of each relevant collapse forcing to shrink the $c^{q_a}$'s,
  and the $\kappa^+$-directed closure of $Col(\kappa^+,<j_{U_\alpha}(\kappa))^{Ult(V,U_\alpha)}$ on the $C^{q_a}$'s,
  we may let $q$ be a lower bound of $\seq{q_a\middle| a\in [dom(A^p)]^{<\omega}}$.
  
  By \thref{magidor_collapse_diagonalize_all_step}, we have that 
  \[
    \seq{q \frown \vec{\nu} \middle| \nu\in \left[\prod A^q(\alpha)\right]^{<\omega} \text{ increasing}}
  \]
  meets $\mathcal{D}$ below $q$ if possible. That means that for each applicable $\vec{\nu}$, if some direct extension of $q\frown \vec{\nu}$ lies in $\mathcal{D}$ then $q\frown \vec{\nu}\in \mathcal{D}$ already. 
  
  We will now find homogeneous families of such $\nu$, in the following sense.
  Let $h:\left[\prod A^q(\alpha)\right]^{<\omega}\to \{0,1\}$\footnote{
    $h$ as defined is not exactly a map on this domain, but rather is a map on increasing finite sequences drawn from the measure one family of $A^q(\alpha)$'s.
  },
  \[
    h(\vec{\nu})=\begin{cases}
      1 & q\frown \vec{\nu}\in\mathcal{D} \\
      0 & \text{otherwise} \\
    \end{cases}
  \]
  By \thref{simult_indisc_easy}\footnote{
    Technically, \thref{simult_indisc_easy} applies independently to $h$ on each subinterval between points in $dom(f^q) \cup \{\kappa\}$, taking reflected measures as needed.
  }, 
  there is some $r\leq^* q$ with $c^r=c^q$ such that for every $n$ and every $a\in [dom(A^r)]^{<\omega}$,
  \[
    h \upharpoonright \prod^\uparrow_{\alpha\in a} A^r(\alpha)
  \]
  is constant.
  
  But then $r$ is finally as desired, as there is some $a$ so that every $a$-step extension of $r$ is in $\mathcal{D}$.
  To see this, observe that by density, there must be some $\vec{\nu}$ such that some direct extension of $r\frown \vec{\nu}\in\mathcal{D}$;
  but then $r\frown \vec{\nu}\in\mathcal{D}$, and since $r\frown\vec{\nu}\leq^* q\frown\vec{\nu}$, by construction of $q$, $q\frown \vec{\nu}\in\mathcal{D}$, so $h(\vec{\nu})=1$.
  Let $a=dom(\vec{\nu})$; by the homogeneity of $h$, every $a$-step extension of $r$ is in $\mathcal{D}$.
\end{proof}

Combining elements of the aforementioned proof yields the following restricted diagonalization lemma:

\begin{lemma}[Diagonalization Lemma]
  Let $p\in\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})$; let 
  \[
    E=\left\{\vec{\nu}:a\to\kappa \middle| a\in [dom(A^p)]^{<\omega}, \vec{\nu}\in \prod_{\alpha \in a} A^p(\alpha), \text{ and }p\frown \vec{\nu}\text{ is a condition below }p\right\}
  \]
  Let $\seq{p_{\vec{\nu}} \middle| \vec{\nu}\in E}$ be a family such that:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $p_{\vec{\nu}}\leq^* p \frown \vec{\nu}$
    \item for all $a$, for all $\alpha\in dom(a)$, there is a $t:A^p(\alpha)\to \{p_{\vec{\nu}}\mid \vec{\nu}\in E\}$ such that $t(\mu)$ is some $\vec{\nu}$ such that $dom(\vec{\nu})=a$, $\vec{\nu}(\alpha)=\mu$, and
    \[
      \left[\mu\mapsto c^{p_{t(\mu)}}(\alpha)\right]\in K_\alpha \text{( or }k_\alpha^\beta(\rho)\text{)}
    \]
  \end{enumerate}
  Then there is some $q\leq^* p$ such that whenever $q\frown\vec{\nu}$ is a valid condition, $q\frown \vec{\nu}\leq^* p_{\vec{\nu}}$
\end{lemma}

And as with vanilla Magidor forcing, we obtain the sentential version of the Prikry lemma.

The proof is functionally the same as in \thref{magidor_prikry_type_sentential}, but with collapse terms $c$ and $C$ that may need further extension.

\begin{lemma}[Prikry-type lemma, sentential version I]\thlabel{magidor_collapse_prikry_sentential}
  Let $p\in\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})$, and let $\sigma$ be a sentence of the forcing language. 
  Then some $q\leq^* p$ decides $\sigma$.
\end{lemma}

Further arguments along the lines of \thref{magidor_prikry_type_open_dense_better} yield a tail-change version:

\begin{lemma}[Prikry-type lemma, tail-change version]\thlabel{magidor_collapse_prikry_open_dense_better}
  If $p$ is a condition, $\mathcal{D}$ is an open dense set, and $\beta\in dom(f^p)$,
  then there is a direct extension $q\leq^* p$ such that $(q)_{\beta} = (p)_{\beta}$ and whenever $a\in [dom(A^p)]^{<\omega}$, if $r$ is an $a$-step extension of $q$ and $r\in \mathcal{D}$, then every $a\setminus (dom(r^p)\cap \beta)$-step extension of $(r)_\beta \frown (q)^\beta$ is also in $\mathcal{D}$.
\end{lemma}

Likewise, we have a similar sentential version with tail changes:

\begin{lemma}[Prikry-type lemma, tail-change sentential version]\thlabel{magidor_collapse_prikry_sentential_better}
  Let $\sigma$ be a sentence of the forcing language, let $p\in \mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})$, and let $\beta\in dom(f^p)$.
  Then there is some $q\leq^* p$ such that $(q)_\beta=(p)_\beta$ and if $r\leq q$ such that $r$ decides $\sigma$, then $(r)_\beta \frown (q)^\beta$ decides $\sigma$ the same way.
\end{lemma}

This proof is similar to \thref{magidor_prikry_type_sentential_better}, except with more care needed during the diagonalization step to concentrate the already-chosen collapse terms.

As for cardinal arithmetic in $V^{\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})}$, we have a Magidor sequence $\seq{\beta_\eta \middle| \eta<\lambda}$, collapses of cardinals in $(\beta_\eta^+,\beta_{\eta+1})$ for every $\eta \in \lambda \cup\{-1\}$, and preservation of all other cardinals. 
Explicitly:

\begin{lemma}
  Let $\delta$ be a $V$-cardinal and let $\seq{\beta_\eta \middle| \eta<\lambda}$ be the Magidor sequence added by some $\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})$-generic $G$. Then:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $\delta\in (\beta_\eta^+,\beta_{\eta+1})$ for some $\eta$, then $\delta$ is collapsed to size $\beta_\eta^+$
    \item If $\delta=\beta_\eta$ for some $\eta$ or $\delta=\kappa$, then $\delta$ is preserved
    \item If $\delta=\beta_{\eta+1}$ for some $\eta$ or $\delta=\beta_0$ or $\delta\leq \omega_2$ or $\delta>\kappa$, then $\delta$ is $V[G]$-regular.
  \end{enumerate}
  Thus in $V[G]$, $\kappa=(\aleph_\lambda)^{V[G]}$.
\end{lemma}

The collapsing part is easy to see, as $G$ adds $Col(\beta_\eta^+,<\beta_{\eta+1})$-generics for every $\eta$.
Much as in vanilla Magidor forcing, the preservation argument emulates \thref{magidor_preserves_cardinals} with the help of \thref{magidor_collapse_prikry_sentential_better}.

As for a characterization of genericity along the lines of \thref{magidor_geometric_iff_generic}, we have that the Magidor generic sequence is geometric, along with a geometricity notion for the collapses, as follows:

\begin{proposition} \thlabel{magidor_collapse_generic_implies_geometric}
  Let $G$ be $\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})$-generic.
  Let
  \[
    \vec{\beta}=\seq{\beta_\eta \middle| \eta<\lambda} = \bigcup_{p\in G} f^p
  \]
  and for each $\eta<\lambda$, let 
  \[
    F_\eta=\bigcup_{p\in G, \eta\in dom(f^p)} c^p(\eta)
  \]
  Then
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \label{magidor_collapse_generic_implies_geometric:sequence} $\vec{\beta}$ is increasing, normal, and has supremum $\kappa$
  
    \item \label{magidor_collapse_generic_implies_geometric:measures} for all $\seq{A_\eta \middle| \eta<\lambda}\in V$ with each $A_\eta\in U_\eta$, for coboundedly many $\zeta<\lambda$, $\beta_\zeta\in A_\zeta$
    
    \item \label{magidor_collapse_generic_implies_geometric:collapses} for all $\eta$, $F_\eta$ is $Col(\beta_\eta^+,<\beta_{\eta+1})$-generic over $V$
    
    \item \label{magidor_collapse_generic_implies_geometric:collapse_futures} 
    for all $\seq{C_\eta\middle| \eta<\lambda}$ in $V$ with each $C_\eta$ a map from a measure one set in $U_\eta$ to collapses such that each $[C_\eta]\in K_\eta$: for coboundedly many $\zeta<\lambda$, $C_\zeta(\beta_\zeta)\in F_\zeta$
    
    \item and the above items reflect down to each limit ordinal $\eta<\lambda$ with respect to the reflected measures $r$ and reflected guiding generics $k$.
    More precisely, if $\eta$ is a limit ordinal below $\lambda$, then:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \label{magidor_collapse_generic_implies_geometric:refl_measures} for each $\seq{A_\zeta\mid \zeta<\eta}$ in $V$ with each $A_\eta$ in $r^\eta_\zeta(\beta_\eta)$, for coboundedly many $\zeta$, $\beta_\zeta\in A_\zeta$;
      
      \item \label{magidor_collapse_generic_implies_geometric:refl_collapse_futures}
      for all $\seq{C_\zeta \mid \zeta<\eta}$ in $V$ with each $C_\zeta$ a map from a measure one set in $r^\eta_\zeta(\beta_\eta)$ to collapses such that each $[C_\eta]\in k^\eta_\zeta(\beta_\eta)$: for coboundedly many $\zeta<\eta$, $C_\zeta(\beta_\eta)\in F_\zeta$
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Items \ref{magidor_collapse_generic_implies_geometric:sequence}, \ref{magidor_collapse_generic_implies_geometric:measures}, and \ref{magidor_collapse_generic_implies_geometric:refl_measures}
  follow from standard density and factoring arguments for Magidor forcing (c.f. \thref{magidor_generic_implies_geometric}).
  In the casee of \ref{magidor_collapse_generic_implies_geometric:refl_measures}, we factor to $\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})_{(\eta,\beta_\eta)}$, which is its own Magidor forcing with guided interleaved collapses.
  
  Item \ref{magidor_collapse_generic_implies_geometric:collapses} follows since below the weakest $p$ for which $f^p(\eta)=\beta_\eta$ and $f^p(\eta+1)=\beta_{\eta+1}$, the collection 
  \[
    \{c^q(\eta) \mid q\leq p\}
  \]
  is equal to $Col(\beta_\eta^+,<\beta_{\eta+1})$.
  
  Item \ref{magidor_collapse_generic_implies_geometric:collapse_futures} follows from the fact that given such $\seq{C_\eta \middle| \eta<\lambda}$, since the guiding generics are filters, 
  \[
    \left\{p\in\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U}) \middle| \forall \eta \in dom(A^p) \setminus (\max dom(f^p)+1) \ [C^p(\eta)]_{U_\eta}<[C_\eta]_{U_\eta} \right\}
  \]
  is dense.
  
  Finally, Item \ref{magidor_collapse_generic_implies_geometric:refl_collapse_futures} follows from reflection and factoring:
  let $\eta$ be a limit point and work in $\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})_{(\eta,\beta_\eta)}$.
  Then 
  \[
    \left\{p\in \mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})_{(\eta,\beta_\eta)} \middle|  \forall \zeta \in dom(A^p) \setminus (\max dom(f^p)+1) \ [C^p(\zeta)]_{r_\zeta^\eta(\beta_\eta)}<[C_\eta]_{r_\zeta^\eta(\beta_\eta)}\right\}
  \]
  is dense in $\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})_{(\eta,\beta_\eta)}$.
\end{proof}
  
As with Magidor forcing, the above is a precise characterization of genericity for $\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})$:
  
\begin{theorem}
  In $V^{\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})}$, suppose $\seq{\beta_\eta \mid \eta<\lambda}$ is increasing, normal, and has limit $\kappa$, and for each $\eta$, suppose $F_\eta$ be $Col(\beta_\eta^+,<\beta_{\eta+1})$-generic over $V$.
  
  Suppose the conclusion of \thref{magidor_collapse_generic_implies_geometric} applies to $\seq{\beta_\eta \mid \eta<\lambda}$ and the $F_\eta$'s, and define
  \[
    H=\left\{(f,c,A,C) \middle|
      \begin{array}{l}
        f\text{ is a finite subsequence of }\vec{\beta}, \\
        \forall \alpha\in dom(f) \ c(\alpha)\in F_\alpha \\
        A\in V \text{ and }dom(A)=\lambda\setminus dom(f), \\        
        \forall \eta \in dom(A) \ A(\eta)\in U_\eta \text{ or the relevant }r^\gamma_\eta(\beta_\gamma), \\
        \forall \eta\in dom(A) \ \beta_\eta\in A(\eta), \\
        C\in V \text{ and }\forall \eta \in dom(A) \ [C(\eta)]_{U_\eta}\in K_\eta (\text{ or }r^\gamma_\eta(\beta_\gamma),k^\gamma_\eta(\beta_\gamma)
      \end{array}
    \right\}
  \]
  Then $H$ is $\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})$-generic over $V$.
\end{theorem}

As with the characterization of genericity for Magidor forcing (c.f. \thref{magidor_geometric_iff_generic}), the proof is by induction on the length of $\vec{U}$.

\begin{proof}
  Will be forthcoming, and utilizes \thref{magidor_collapse_prikry_open_dense_better} for the limit step.
\end{proof}

\begin{conjecture}
  In $V^{\mathbb{MC}(\vec{U})}$ with $\lambda=\omega_1$, 
  \[
    MS(\seq{\aleph_{2n+3}\middle| n<\omega}\frown \seq{\aleph_{\alpha+2n}\middle| \omega\leq\alpha<\omega_1,n<\omega};\omega_1)
  \]
  holds.
\end{conjecture}

It seems plausible that this might hold, under the following (very rough) outline.
Suppose that $p\forces \dot{F}:[\kappa]^{<\omega}\to\kappa$ is a Skolem function for some algebra on $\kappa$.
Let $\dot{S_\alpha}$ be names for a family of stationary sets as in conjecture.
WLOG, $f^p=\seq{(-1,\omega_1)}$.
Then:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $F^*(x,c,t)=\beta$ if for some $A$, $C$, $(t,c,A,C)\leq p$ and $(t,c,A,C)\forces \dot{F}(x)=\beta$, and $\emptyset$ otherwise.
  \item For each $x$, the collection of conditions deciding the value of $\dot{F}(x)$ is dense below $p$, so by the \thref{magidor_collapse_meets_dense_generic_one_step}, some family of them ought to be diagonalizable to some $q_x\leq^* p$.
  \item Find some nice enough family of $x$'s and be able to homogenize those $q_x$'s to achieve the desired $MS$.
\end{enumerate}
