\section{Future Directions}
\label{accessible_ms:future}

Investigating Magidor-like forcings with collapses, and their characterizations of genericity, was motivated by the question of mutual stationarity properties at $\aleph_{\omega_1}$.

In particular, one might hazard the following mutual stationarity property at every other $\aleph$ below $\aleph_{\omega_1}$:

\begin{conjecture}
  Suppose $V\models\mathrm{ZFC}+\mathrm{GCH}$, and let $\vec{U}$ be an $(\omega_1)$-length Mitchell order increasing system of measures on $\kappa$, with $U_{\omega_1}$ Mitchell order above $\vec{U}$ giving rise to guiding generics for $\vec{U}$.
  
  Then in $V^{\mathbb{MC}\left(\vec{U}\right)}$, 
  \[
    MS(\seq{\aleph_{2n+3}\mid n<\omega} \frown \seq{\aleph_{\alpha+2n}\mid \alpha<\omega_1 \text{ limit}, 0<n<\omega}; \omega_1)
  \]
  holds.
\end{conjecture}

One possible idea would be to emulate the proof of $MS(\seq{\aleph_{2n+3}\mid n<\omega}; \omega_1)$ in \cite{koepke_ms_omega_1}.

Future work could include mutual stationarity principles of larger fixed cofinality or at every $\aleph_\alpha$ below $\aleph_{\omega_1}$, perhaps using supercompact versions of $\mathbb{MC}\left(\vec{U}\right)$.
