\section{Chapter-specific preliminaries}
\label{destroy_sat:preliminaries}

Much of the necessary background can be found in Chapter \ref{forcing}; we cover more chapter-specific preliminaries here.

Forcing poset closure, and properness, relate to presaturation; we now summarize what properness is, and how both closure and properness relate to presaturation.

Let $\delta$ be regular uncountable, and let $H\supsetneq\delta$.
Then we write $\mathcal{P}_\delta(H)$ for all subsets of $H$ of size $<\delta$, and $\mathcal{P}^*_\delta(H)$ to denote the set of all $x\in \mathcal{P}_\delta(H)$ such that $x\cap\delta\in\delta$.

\begin{definition}
Let $\mathbb{P}$ be a notion of forcing, $\theta$ sufficiently large so that $\mathbb{P}\in H_\theta$, and $M\prec (H_\theta,\in,\mathbb{P})$. 

We say that $p\in\mathbb{P}$ is an \emph{$(M,\mathbb{P})$-master condition} if for every dense $D\in M$, $D\cap M$ is predense below $p$; equivalently, $p\forces_{\mathbb{P}} M[\dot{G}_{\mathbb{P}}]\cap V=M$. 

Additionally, we say that $p$ is an \emph{$(M,\mathbb{P})$-strong master condition} if for every $p'\leq p$, there is some $p'_M\in M\cap\mathbb{P}$ such that every extension of $p'_M$ in $M\cap\mathbb{P}$ is compatible with $p'$. 
\footnote{It is straightforward to see that strong master conditions are also master conditions.}

Further, $\mathbb{P}$ is \emph{(strongly) proper with respect to $M$} if every $p\in M\cap\mathbb{P}$ has a $q\leq p$ such that $q$ is an $(M,\mathbb{P})$-(strong) master condition.

We say that $\mathbb{P}$ is \emph{(strongly) $\delta$-proper on a stationary set} if there is a stationary subset $S$ of $\mathcal{P}^*_\delta(H_\theta)$ such that for every $M\in S$, $M\prec (H_\theta,\in,\mathbb{P})$ and $\mathbb{P}$ is (strongly) proper with respect to $M$.
\end{definition}

Note that $\{M\in \mathcal{P}^*_\delta(H_\theta)\mid M\prec (H_\theta,\in,\mathbb{P})\}$ is a club subset of $\mathcal{P}^*_\delta(H_\theta)$; so a forcing being $\delta$-proper on a stationary set really only depends on the properness condition.

\begin{fact}\label{proper-implies-presat}
If $\mathbb{P}$ is $\delta$-proper on a stationary set, then $\mathbb{P}$ is $\delta$-presaturated.
\end{fact}

This fact appears as Fact 2.8 of \cite{cox_eskew_kill_sat_save_presat}, with proof; their proof, in turn, generalizes a result of Foreman and Magidor in the case of $\delta=\omega_1$ (namely, Proposition 3.2 of \cite{foreman_magidor_lcs_ctx_ch}).

For the posets we will be working with, we will have a specific stationary subset witnessing $\delta$-properness:

\begin{definition}
For $\delta$ regular and $\theta>>\delta$, we say that $IA_{<\delta}\subseteq \mathcal{P}^*_\delta(H_\theta)$, 
the ``internally approachable sets of length $<\delta$", 
is the collection of all $M\in \mathcal{P}^*_\delta(H_\theta)$, with $|M|=|M\cap \delta|$, that are \emph{internally approachable},
i.e. such that there is a $\zeta<\delta$ and a continuous $\subseteq$-increasing sequence $\seq{N_\alpha\mid \alpha<\zeta}$ whose union is $M$, such that $\vec{N}\upharpoonright \alpha\in M$ for all $\alpha<\zeta$.
\end{definition}

In a sense, internal approachability is preserved by any generic extension:

\begin{fact}\label{principle-A}
Suppose $\mathbb{P}$ is a poset, $M\prec(H_\theta,\in,\mathbb{P})$, $\seq{N_\alpha\mid\alpha<\zeta}$ witnesses that $M\in IA_{<\delta}$, and $G$ is $(V,\mathbb{P})$-generic.
Then in $V[G]$, $\seq{N_\alpha[G]\mid \alpha<\zeta}$ witnesses that $M[G]\in IA_{<\delta}$. (Without loss of generality, we may assume that $\mathbb{P}\in N_0$.)
\end{fact}

It is a standard fact that $IA_{<\delta}$ is stationary.
The following lemma makes clear its utility:

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma-iaposets}
Let $\delta$ be regular and uncountable. Then:
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
\item\label{lemma-iaposets:cc}
If $\mathbb{P}$ is $\delta$-cc and $M\prec (H_\theta,\in,\mathbb{P})$ is an element of $\mathcal{P}^*_\delta(H_\theta)$ (i.e. if $M\cap\delta\in\delta$), then $1_\mathbb{P}$ is an $(M,\mathbb{P})$-master condition; in particular $\mathbb{P}$ is $\delta$-proper on (a club subset of) $\mathcal{P}^*_\delta(H_\theta)$.

\item\label{lemma-iaposets:closed}
If $\mathbb{Q}$ is $<\delta$-closed then $\mathbb{Q}$ is $\delta$-proper on $IA_{<\delta}$.

\item\label{lemma-iaposets:iter}
If $\mathbb{P}$ is $\delta$-proper on $IA_{<\delta}$ and $\forces_\mathbb{P}``\dot{\mathbb{Q}}\text{ is }\delta\text{-cc}$ or $\forces_\mathbb{P}``\dot{\mathbb{Q}}\text{ is }<\delta\text{-closed}$ then $\mathbb{P}*\mathbb{\dot{Q}}$ is $\delta$-proper on $IA_{<\delta}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

This is roughly Fact 2.9 out of \cite{cox_eskew_kill_sat_save_presat}. The following proof is largely reproduced from \cite{cox_eskew_kill_sat_save_presat} as well.

\begin{proof}
For part \ref{lemma-iaposets:cc}, let $A\in M$ be a maximal antichain in $\mathbb{P}$.
Since $|A|<\delta$ and $M\cap\delta\in\delta$, we have that $A\subseteq M$.
Thus $1_\mathbb{P}\forces M[\dot{G}]\cap\check{V}=M$, so $1_\mathbb{P}$ is a master condition for $M$.

Part \ref{lemma-iaposets:closed} is due to Foreman and Magidor in \cite{foreman_magidor_lcs_ctx_ch}. %I can't specifically find it here, but Cox & Eskew say it's in there.

As for part \ref{lemma-iaposets:iter}, let $G$ be $\mathbb{P}$-generic over $V$.
Suppose that $M\prec (H_\theta,\in,\mathbb{P}*\dot{\mathbb{Q}})$ and $M\in IA_{<\delta}$.
By Fact \ref{principle-A}, combined with \ref{lemma-iaposets:cc} and \ref{lemma-iaposets:closed},
$\mathbb{P}$ forces that $\dot{\mathbb{Q}}$ is proper with respect to $M[\dot{G}]$.
Hence $\mathbb{P}*\dot{\mathbb{Q}}$ is proper with respect to $M$.
\end{proof}

Item \ref{lemma-iaposets:cc} lends itself to a useful properness result for some forcing iterations:
\begin{corollary}\label{corollary-superproper-iterate-proper-general}
  Suppose $\rho$ is a cardinal less than $\delta$ and $\mathbb{P}=\seq{\mathbb{P}_\alpha \mid \alpha<\rho}$ is an iteration of posets with inverse support at $\rho$ such that for every $\alpha<\rho$ and every $M'\prec (H_\theta,\in,\mathbb{P}_\alpha)$, $1_{\mathbb{P}_\alpha}$ is an $(M',\mathbb{P}_\alpha)$-master condition for $\mathbb{P}_\alpha$.
  
  Then for every $M\prec (H_\theta,\in,\mathbb{P})$, $1_{\mathbb{P}}$ is an $(M,\mathbb{P})$-master condition for $\mathbb{P}$, and thus $\mathbb{P}$ is $\delta$-proper on a club subset of $\mathcal{P}^*_\delta(H_\theta)$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  Let $M$ be such, and let $D\in M$ be open dense in $\mathbb{P}$.
  Then the projection $D \upharpoonright \mathbb{P}_\alpha$ is open dense in $\mathbb{P}_\alpha$ for each $\alpha$, so by assumption $(D \upharpoonright \mathbb{P}_\alpha) \cap M$ is nonempty, as witnessed by $p_\alpha$.
  Furthermore, by commutativity of the projections, the $\seq{p_\alpha \mid \alpha<\rho}$ is a descending sequence in $\mathbb{P}$, so by inverse limit, has a lower bound $p\in D$.
  Since $\rho<\delta$, we may assume $M$ is closed under $\cf(\rho)$-sequences and thus $p\in M$.
\end{proof}

Our arguments will utilize the following special case of Corollary \ref{corollary-superproper-iterate-proper-general}:
\begin{corollary}\label{corollary-superproper-iterate-proper}
  Let $\rho$ be a singular cardinal, let $\delta=\rho^+$, and suppose $\mathbb{P}=\seq{\mathbb{P}_\alpha \mid \alpha<\rho}$ is an Easton support iteration of $\delta$-cc posets.
  Then $\mathbb{P}$ is $\delta$-proper on a club subset of $\mathcal{P}_\delta^*(H_\theta)$.
\end{corollary}

Presaturation comes with some partial cofinality preservation:
\begin{fact}
If $\mathbb{P}$ is $\lambda$-presaturated for $\lambda$ regular then 
\[\forces_{\mathbb{P}} cof^V(\geq\lambda)=cof^{V[\dot{G}]}(\geq\lambda)\]
\end{fact}
The above fact has a partial converse. We will not make use of it, but it is another known way to argue that certain iterations of presaturated forcings are presaturated:
\begin{fact}\label{cof->presat}
If $\mathbb{P}$ is $\lambda^{+\omega}$-cc for some regular $\lambda\geq\omega_1$ and
\[\forall n\in\omega \ \forces_{\mathbb{P}} cf^{V[\dot{G}]}\left(\left(\lambda^{+n}\right)^V\right)\geq\lambda\]
then $\mathbb{P}$ is $\lambda$-presaturated.
\end{fact}

This appears as Fact 2.11 in \cite{cox_eskew_kill_sat_save_presat}, which in turn is a generalization of Theorem 4.3 of \cite{baumgartner_taylor_sat_gen_ees_two}.

In line with Section \ref{forcing:ideals_measures}, if $I\in V$ is an ideal on $\kappa$ and $\mathbb{P}$ is a notion of forcing understood from context, then we will write $\overline{I}:=\left\{N\in \mathcal{P}^{V^\mathbb{P}}(\kappa)\mid \exists A\in I \ N\subseteq A\right\}$.

To compute presaturation properties of ideals, these are the two forms of Foreman's Duality Theorem that we will use:

\begin{lemma}\label{foreman_ideals_gen_ees:groundideals}
For a $\kappa$-complete, $\kappa^+$ saturated $I\in V$, $\overline{I}$ is $\kappa^+$-saturated in $V^\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if $\forces_{\mathcal{B}_I} \dot{j}_I(\mathbb{Q})$ is $\kappa^+$-cc.
\end{lemma}
 
This appears as Corollary 7.21 in \cite{foreman_ideals_gen_ees}.

\begin{theorem}
\label{easyduality}
Let $I$ be a $\kappa$-complete normal precipitous ideal in $V$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ be a $\kappa$-cc poset. 
Then $\overline{I}$ is precipitous and there is a canonical isomorphism witnessing that
\[\mathcal{B}\left(\mathbb{Q} * \mathcal{B}_{\overline{I}}\right)\cong \mathcal{B}\left(\mathcal{B}_I * \dot{j}_I\left(\mathbb{Q}\right)\right)\]
where $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{P})$ refers to the Boolean completion of $\mathbb{P}$.
\end{theorem}

This statement appears in \cite{cox_eskew_kill_sat_save_presat} as Fact 2.24, and is a corollary of Theorem 7.14 of \cite{foreman_ideals_gen_ees}.
