\chapter{Destroying Saturation while Preserving Presaturation}
\label{destroy_sat}

(TODO: better crossreferences with the rest of the thesis; move some preliminaries to the intro chapter.)

Our first anti-saturation result shows that it is consistent to, with forcing, destroy the saturation of a large class of ideals while preserving their presaturation.
This answers an open question of \cite{cox_eskew_kill_sat_save_presat}.

This chapter is a modified version of my preprint \cite{schoem_destroy_sat_inaccessible} on the arXiv.
