\chapter{Destroying Saturation while Preserving Presaturation}
\label{destroy_sat}

This is largely to be a copy-paste of my preprint on destroying saturation while preserving presaturation at an inaccessible. Preliminaries should \emph{maybe} get moved to the introduction as much as possible? If applicable elsewhere perhaps, else can just sit in a self-contained specific background here.
