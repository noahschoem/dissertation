\chapter{Destroying Saturation while Preserving Presaturation}
\label{destroy_sat}

This is largely to be a copy-paste of my preprint on destroying saturation while preserving presaturation at an inaccessible. Preliminaries will get moved to the introduction as much as possible, including saturation, presaturation, and Foreman's Duality Theorem.

The preprint is available at \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06704} so may not make it into this draft, but will definitely be in the final thesis.
