My thesis consists of novel anti-saturation results on ideals.

After a brief introduction covering historical context and the preliminaries necessary to understand the thesis,
we begin by extending an anti-saturation result for ideals on the successors of regular cardinals to inaccessibles, encapsulated in the following two theorems:

\begin{thm}
Suppose $V$ is a universe of $ZFC+GCH$ with an inaccessible cardinal $\kappa$ admitting $\kappa$-complete, normal, $\kappa^+$-saturated ideals on $\kappa$ concentrating on regular cardinals below $\kappa$ (i.e. such that $Reg_\kappa\in I^+$).
Then there is a poset $\mathbb{Q}$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
\item $V^\mathbb{Q}\models``\text{there are no }\kappa\text{-complete, }\kappa^+\text{-saturated ideals on }\kappa \text{  concentrating on regular cardinals}"$ 
\item If $I\in V$ is a $\kappa$-complete, normal, $\kappa^+$-saturated ideal on $\kappa$ concentrating on regular cardinals, 
then $V^\mathbb{Q}\models``\overline{I}\text{ is }\kappa^+\text{-presaturated}"$ 
\end{enumerate}
where $\overline{I}=\{A\in \mathcal{P}^{V^\mathbb{Q}}(\kappa) \mid \exists N\in I \ A\subseteq N\}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
With the same assumptions, there is a $\mathbb{Q}$ such that if $\delta>\kappa$ is a regular cardinal, $I\in V$ is normal, fine, $\delta$-presaturated ideal on $Z$ of uniform completeness $\kappa$ concentrating on regular cardinals below $\kappa$ such that
\begin{itemize}
\item $\forces_{\mathcal{B}_I} |\dot{j}_I(\kappa)|=\delta<\dot{j}_I(\kappa)$
where $\dot{j}_I$ is a name for the generic elementary embedding $j_I:V\to M$ added by $\mathcal{B}_I:=\mathcal{P}(Z)/I$;
\item $\mathcal{B}_I$ is proper on $IA_{<\delta}$;
\end{itemize}
then in $V^\mathbb{Q}$,
\begin{itemize}
\item $\overline{I}$ is not $\delta$-saturated
\item but $\overline{I}$ is $\delta$-presaturated
\end{itemize}
where $\overline{I}$ is as above.
\end{thm}

We then turn to mutually stationary sequences and $MS(\seq{\kappa_\alpha \mid \alpha<\mu, \ \kappa_\alpha\text{ successor}})$, the principle that every family $S_\alpha\subseteq \kappa_\alpha$ of stationary sets is mutually stationary.

We prove:
\begin{thm}
  Let $\seq{\beta_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda}$ be a sequence generic for a Magidor forcing $\mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)$ of length $\lambda$.
  Then there is a cofinite subset $K$ of $\seq{\beta_\alpha \mid \alpha\text{ successor}<\lambda}$ such that every family $S_\alpha\subseteq \beta_\alpha\in K$ of stationary sets is mutually stationary.
\end{thm}

Finally, we describe progress on a project to obtain 
\[
  MS\left(\seq{\aleph_{2n+3}\middle| n<\omega}\frown \seq{\aleph_{\alpha+2n}\middle| \omega\leq\alpha<\omega_1,n<\omega};\omega_1\right)
\]
a mutual stationarity result at $\aleph_{\omega_1}$, on every other successor cardinal below, for stationary subsets consisting of fixed cofinalith $\omega_1$.
To that end, we describe a Magidor-type forcing $\mathbb{MC}\left(\vec{U}\right)$ that changes a measurable cardinal $\kappa$ into $\aleph_{\omega_1}$, and state and prove Prikry-type lemmata (\thref{magidor_collapse_prikry_open_dense} and \thref{magidor_collapse_prikry_open_dense_better}) and prove a characterization of genericy for $\mathbb{MC}\left(\vec{U}\right)$ in \thref{magidor_collapse_generic_implies_geometric} and \thref{magidor_collapse_generic_iff_geometric}.
