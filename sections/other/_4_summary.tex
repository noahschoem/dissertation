This thesis consists primarily of anti-saturation results on ideals.

After a brief introduction covering historical context and necessary preliminaries,
we extend an anti-saturation result for ideals on the successors of regular cardinals to inaccessibles:

\begin{thm}
  Suppose $V$ is a universe of $ZFC+GCH$ with an inaccessible cardinal $\kappa$ admitting $\kappa$-complete, normal, $\kappa^+$-saturated ideals on $\kappa$ concentrating on regular cardinals below $\kappa$.
  Then there is a generic extension $V^{\mathbb{Q}}$ in which
  \begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
  \item there are no $\kappa$-complete, $\kappa^+$-saturated ideals on $\kappa$ concentrating on regular cardinals,
  \item but if $I\in V$ is a $\kappa$-complete, normal, $\kappa^+$-saturated ideal on $\kappa$ concentrating on regular cardinals, 
  then $V^\mathbb{Q}\models``\overline{I}\text{ is }\kappa^+\text{-presaturated}"$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

We then turn to mutually stationary sequences, and prove:
\begin{thm}
  Let $\seq{\beta_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda}$ be a sequence generic for a Magidor forcing $\mathbb{M}\left(\vec{U}\right)$ of length $\lambda$.
  Then there is a cofinite subset $K$ of $\seq{\beta_\alpha \mid \alpha<\lambda, \alpha\text{ successor}}$ such that every family $S_\alpha\subseteq \beta_\alpha\in K$ of stationary sets is mutually stationary.
\end{thm}

Finally we develop a novel Magidor-like forcing with interleaved collapses and guiding generics $\mathbb{MC}\left(\seq{U_\eta \mid \eta<\lambda}\right)$ and state and prove a characterization of genericity:

\begin{thm}
  Let $\vec{\beta}=\seq{\beta_\eta\mid \eta<\lambda}$ and $\vec{F}=\seq{F_\eta\mid \eta<\lambda}$ be in $V^{\mathbb{MC}\left(\seq{U_\eta \mid \eta<\lambda}\right)}$.
  Then $(\vec{\beta},\vec{F})$ is $\mathbb{MC}\left(\seq{U_\eta \mid \eta<\lambda}\right)$-generic over $V$ precisely when at each limt ordinal $\eta\leq \lambda$, $\vec{\beta}\upharpoonright \eta$ meets $\seq{U_\zeta \mid \zeta<\eta}$ coboundedly often, and $\seq{F_\zeta\mid \zeta<\eta}$ meets the guiding generics coboundedly often.
\end{thm}
