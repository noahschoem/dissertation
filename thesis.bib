Magidor, Canonical structure in the universe of set theory: part one, Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 129 (1–3) (2004) 211–243]. We produce examples of non-tightly stationary mutually stationary sequences, sequences of cardinals on which every sequence of sets is mutually stationary, and mutually stationary sequences not concentrating on a fixed cofinality. We also give an alternative proof for the consistency of the existence of stationarily many non-good points, show that diagonal Prikry forcing preserves certain stationary reflection properties, and study the relationship between some simultaneous reflection principles. Finally we show that the least cardinal where square fails can be the least inaccessible, and show that weak square is incompatible in a strong sense with generic supercompactness.},

abstract = {We study various aspects of the size, including the cardinality, of closed unbounded subsets of [$\lambda$]<$\kappa$, especially when $\lambda$ $\kappa$+n for n $\epsilon${lunate} $\omega$. The problem is resolved into the study of the size of certain stationary sets. Relative to the existence of an $\omega$1-Erd{\"{o}}s cardinal it is shown consistent that $\omega$$\omega$3 < $\omega$$\omega$13 and every closed unbounded subsetof [$\omega$3]<$\omega$2 has cardinality $\omega$$\omega$13. A weakening of the $\omega$1-Erd{\"{o}}s property, $\omega$1-remarkability, is defined and shown to be retained under a large class of Easton-like forcings applied to $\omega$1-Erd{\"{o}}s cardinals. A class of reverse-Easton forcings preserving $\alpha$-Erd{\"{o}}sness is also described, with special attention to the establishment of □-principles. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

@article{levine_sinapova_squares,
abstract = {It is known that if $\kappa$ is inaccessible in V and W is an outer model of V such that ($\kappa$ +) V = ($\kappa$ +) W and cf W ($\kappa$) = $\omega$, then $\kappa$,$\omega$ holds in W. (Many strengthenings of this theorem have been investigated as well.) We show that this theorem does not generalize to uncountable cofinalities: There is a model V in which $\kappa$ is inaccessible, such that there is a forcing extension W of V in which ($\kappa$ +) V = ($\kappa$ +) W and $\omega$ < cf W ($\kappa$) < $\kappa$, while in W , $\kappa$,$\tau$ fails for all $\tau$ < $\kappa$. We make use of Magidor's forcing for singularizing an inaccessible $\kappa$ to have uncountable cofinality. Along the way, we analyze stationary reflection in this model, and we show that it is possible for $\kappa$,cf($\kappa$) to hold in a forcing extension by Magidor's poset if the ground model is prepared with a partial square sequence.},

@article{fuchs_magidor,
abstract = {The main result of this paper is a combinatorial characterization of Magidor-generic sequences. Using this characterization, I show that the critical sequences of certain iterations areMagidorgeneric over the target model. I then employ these results in order to analyze which otherMagidor sequences exist in aMagidor extension. One result in this direction is that ifwe temporarily identifyMagidor sequences with their ranges, then Magidor sequences are maximal, in the sense that they contain any other Magidor sequence that is present in their forcing extension, even if the other sequence is generic for a different Magidor forcing. A stronger result holds if both sequences come from the same forcing: I show that a Magidor sequence is almost unique in its forcing extension, in the sense that any other sequence generic for the same forcing which is present in the same forcing extension coincides with the original sequence at all but finitely many coordinates, and at all limit coordinates. Further, I ask the question: If d ∈V[c], where c and d are Magidor-generic over V, then which Magidor forcing can d be generic for? It turns out that it must essentially be a collapsed version of the Magidor forcing for which c was generic. I treat several related questions as well. Finally, I introduce a special case ofMagidor forcing which I call minimal Magidor forcing. This approach simplifies the forcing, and I prove that it doesn't restrict the class of possible Magidor sequences. That is, if c is generic for a Magidor forcing over V, then it is generic for a minimal Magidor forcing over V.},

@article{koepke_free_subset,
abstract = {A subset X of a structure S is called free in S if ∀ x ∈ X x ∉ S [ X − { x }]; here, S [ Y ] is the substructure of S generated from Y by the functions of S . For $\kappa$, $\lambda$, $\mu$ cardinals, let Fr $\mu$ ( $\kappa$, $\lambda$ ) be the assertion: for every structure S with $\kappa$ ⊂ S which has at most $\mu$ functions and relations there is a subset X ⊂ $\kappa$ free in S of cardinality ≥ $\lambda$ . We show that Fr $\omega$ ( $\omega$ $\omega$ , $\omega$ ), the free-subset property for $\omega$ $\omega$ , is equiconsistent with the existence of a measurable cardinal (2.2,4.4). This answers a question of Devlin [De]. In the first section of this paper we prove some combinatorial facts about Fr $\mu$ ( $\kappa$, $\lambda$ ); in particular the first cardinal $\kappa$ such that Fr $\omega$ ( $\kappa$, $\omega$ ) is weakly inaccessible or of cofinality $\omega$ (1.2). The second section shows that, under Fr $\omega$ ( $\omega$ $\omega$ , $\omega$ ), $\omega$ $\omega$ is measurable in an inner model. For the convenience of readers not acquainted with the core model $\kappa$ , we first deduce the existence of 0 # (2.1) using the inner model L . Then we adapt the proof to the core model and obtain that $\omega$ $\omega$ is measurable in an inner model. For the reverse direction, we essentially apply a construction of Shelah [Sh] who forced Fr $\omega$ ( $\omega$ $\omega$ , $\omega$ ) over a ground model which contains an $\omega$-sequence of measurable cardinals. We show in {\S}4 that indeed a coherent sequence of Ramsey cardinals suffices. In {\S}3 we obtain such a sequence as an endsegment of a Prikry sequence.},
