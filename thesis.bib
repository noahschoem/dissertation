abstract = {Introduction and terminology.In view of the great number of independence problems which have been solved by Cohen's method of forcing, it is not surprising that the ones remaining seem to require more and more sophisticated techniques for their solution. One such technique receiving considerable attention recently is the technique of iterated forcing, in which the set of forcing conditions is built up inductively and the ultimate generic extension is regarded as having been obtained in a series of stages, each one generic over the ones preceding. This technique has its roots in the Solovay-Tennenbaum consistency proof of Martin's Axiom, but recently there has been a series of striking applications of the method and its variations such as Silver's use of reverse Easton forcing, Laver's proof of the consistency of the Borel Conjecture, and Shelah's consistency proof of the nonexistence of P-point ultrafilters.This paper is an introduction to iterated forcing for the reader already familiar with the rudiments of forcing. A more complete discussion of prerequisites will be found below.The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 contains the general definition of an $\alpha$-stage iteration, together with some elementary observations about iterated forcing. In Section 2 the basic facts about chain conditions and closure conditions in iterations are proved, and these results are immediately applied in Sections 3 and 4 to obtain the consistency of Martin's Axiom and of a generalized form of Martin's Axiom.},

@article{baumgartner_taylor_wagon_ns_lcs,
abstract = {Let $\kappa$ denote a regular uncountable cardinal and NS the normal ideal of nonstationary subsets of $\kappa$ . Our results concern the well-known open question whether NS fails to be $\kappa$ + -saturated, i.e., are there $\kappa$ + stationary subsets of $\kappa$ with pairwise intersections nonstationary? Our first observation is: Theorem. NS is $\kappa$ + - saturated iff for every normal ideal J on $\kappa$ there is a stationary set A ⊆ $\kappa$ such that J = NS∣A = { X ⊆ $\kappa$ : X ∩ A ∈ NS }. Turning our attention to large cardinals, we extend the usual (weak) Mahlo hierarchy to define “greatly Mahlo” cardinals and obtain the following: Theorem. If $\kappa$ is greatly Mahlo then NS is not $\kappa$ + -saturated. Theorem. If $\kappa$ is ordinal $\Pi$ 1 1 - indescribable (e.g., weakly compact), ethereal (e.g., subtle), or carries a $\kappa$ - saturated ideal, then $\kappa$ is greatly Mahlo. Moreover, there is a stationary set of greatly Mahlo cardinals below any ordinal $\Pi$ 1 1 - indescribable cardinal . These methods apply to other normal ideals as well; e.g., the subtle ideal on an ineffable cardinal $\kappa$ is not $\kappa$ + -saturated.},

Basic notation not explained here can usually be found in [5]. It will also be necessary to assume a knowledge of the fundamentals of boolean and generic extensions, in the style of Jech's monograph [3]. Consistency results will be stated as assertions about the existence of certain complete boolean algebras, B, C , etc., either outright or in the sense of a countable standard transitive model M of ZFC augmented by hypotheses about the existence of various large cardinals. Proofs will usually be phrased in terms of the forcing relation ⊩ over such an M , especially when they make heavy use of genericity. They are then assertions about Shoenfield-style P -generic extensions M ( G ), in which the ‘names' are required without loss of generality to be elements of M B = ( V B ) M , B is the boolean completion of P in M (cf. [3, p. 50]: the notation there is RO ( P )), the generic G is named by Ĝ ∈ M B such that (⟦ p ∈ Ĝ ⟧ B = p and (cf. [11, p. 361] and [3, pp. 58–59]), and for p ∈ P and c 1 , {\ldots}, c n ∈ M B , p ⊩ $\phi$( c 1 , {\ldots}, c n ) iff ⟦$\phi$( c 1 , {\ldots}, c n )⟧ B ≥ p (cf. [3, pp. 61–62]). Some prior acquaintance with large cardinal theory is also needed. At this writing no comprehensive introductory survey is yet in print, though [1], [10], [12]and [13] provide partial coverage. The scheme of definitions which follows is intended to fix notation and serve as a glossary for reference, and it is followed in turn by a description of the results of the paper. We adopt the convention that $\kappa$, $\lambda$, $\mu$, $\nu$, $\rho$ and $\sigma$ vary over infinite cardinals, and all other lower case Greek letters (except $\chi$, $\phi$, $\psi$, ϵ ) over arbitrary ordinals.},

abstract = {The main result of this paper is a combinatorial characterization of Magidor-generic sequences. Using this characterization, I show that the critical sequences of certain iterations areMagidorgeneric over the target model. I then employ these results in order to analyze which otherMagidor sequences exist in aMagidor extension. One result in this direction is that ifwe temporarily identifyMagidor sequences with their ranges, then Magidor sequences are maximal, in the sense that they contain any other Magidor sequence that is present in their forcing extension, even if the other sequence is generic for a different Magidor forcing. A stronger result holds if both sequences come from the same forcing: I show that a Magidor sequence is almost unique in its forcing extension, in the sense that any other sequence generic for the same forcing which is present in the same forcing extension coincides with the original sequence at all but finitely many coordinates, and at all limit coordinates. Further, I ask the question: If d ∈V[c], where c and d are Magidor-generic over V, then which Magidor forcing can d be generic for? It turns out that it must essentially be a collapsed version of the Magidor forcing for which c was generic. I treat several related questions as well. Finally, I introduce a special case ofMagidor forcing which I call minimal Magidor forcing. This approach simplifies the forcing, and I prove that it doesn't restrict the class of possible Magidor sequences. That is, if c is generic for a Magidor forcing over V, then it is generic for a minimal Magidor forcing over V.},

(Many strengthenings of this theorem have been investigated as well.) We show that this theorem does not generalize to uncountable cofinalities: There is a model V in which $\kappa$ is inaccessible, such that there is a forcing extension W of V in which ($\kappa$ +) V = ($\kappa$ +) W and $\omega$ < cf W ($\kappa$) < $\kappa$, while in W , $\kappa$,$\tau$ fails for all $\tau$ < $\kappa$. We make use of Magidor's forcing for singularizing an inaccessible $\kappa$ to have uncountable cofinality. Along the way, we analyze stationary reflection in this model, and we show that it is possible for $\kappa$,cf($\kappa$) to hold in a forcing extension by Magidor's poset if the ground model is prepared with a partial square sequence.},

By combining methods of strong ideals, supercompact embeddings, and Prikry-type posets, we obtain three consistency results concerning mutually stationary sets, and answer a question of Foreman and Magidor concerning stationary sequences on the first uncountable cardinals, $\aleph_n$, $1 \leq n < \omega$.},

This MS property states that any sequence of independently chosen stationary subsets S_n of the Aleph_n (of fixed cofinality omega_1) is mutually stationary below aleph_omega.},

@article{koepke_free_subset,
abstract = {A subset X of a structure S is called free in S if ∀ x ∈ X x ∉ S [ X − { x }]; here, S [ Y ] is the substructure of S generated from Y by the functions of S . For $\kappa$, $\lambda$, $\mu$ cardinals, let Fr $\mu$ ( $\kappa$, $\lambda$ ) be the assertion: for every structure S with $\kappa$ ⊂ S which has at most $\mu$ functions and relations there is a subset X ⊂ $\kappa$ free in S of cardinality ≥ $\lambda$ . We show that Fr $\omega$ ( $\omega$ $\omega$ , $\omega$ ), the free-subset property for $\omega$ $\omega$ , is equiconsistent with the existence of a measurable cardinal (2.2,4.4). This answers a question of Devlin [De]. In the first section of this paper we prove some combinatorial facts about Fr $\mu$ ( $\kappa$, $\lambda$ ); in particular the first cardinal $\kappa$ such that Fr $\omega$ ( $\kappa$, $\omega$ ) is weakly inaccessible or of cofinality $\omega$ (1.2). The second section shows that, under Fr $\omega$ ( $\omega$ $\omega$ , $\omega$ ), $\omega$ $\omega$ is measurable in an inner model. For the convenience of readers not acquainted with the core model $\kappa$ , we first deduce the existence of 0 # (2.1) using the inner model L . Then we adapt the proof to the core model and obtain that $\omega$ $\omega$ is measurable in an inner model. For the reverse direction, we essentially apply a construction of Shelah [Sh] who forced Fr $\omega$ ( $\omega$ $\omega$ , $\omega$ ) over a ground model which contains an $\omega$-sequence of measurable cardinals. We show in {\S}4 that indeed a coherent sequence of Ramsey cardinals suffices. In {\S}3 we obtain such a sequence as an endsegment of a Prikry sequence.},
