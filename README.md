Noah Schoem's PhD Dissertation
===

Welcome to the LaTeX source for my PhD dissertation!


Building

If you want to build this from source yourself, you'll need `latexmk`, `makeglossaries` and `pdflatex` on your system,
along with a pretty standard set of latex packages.  Once that's the case,
building the PDF should just be a `make clean && make`.
